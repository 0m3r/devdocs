# Services Use Case: Magento 1 and Magento 2 Side-By-Side

<p><a href="https://github.com/magento/devdocs/blob/master/guides/m2devgde/v1.0.0.0/compare_mage1_mage2.md" target="_blank"><em>Help us improve this page</em></a>&nbsp;<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}common/images/newWindow.gif"/></p>

As an example of the power and simplicity of the Magento 2 service framework, let's take a look at two side-by-side implementations:

*	An address book in Magento 1 and in Magento 2.
*	Customer registration during checkout in Magento 1 and Magento 2.

The implementations are presented at a high level without all the details; however, you'll see that the services framework provides significant improvments compared to Magento 1.

## Implementing an Address Book

This example gets an address from an address book application and sends it back as HTML.
