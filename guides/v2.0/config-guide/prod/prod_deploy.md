Since publishing this topic, we have learned that it is not acceptable to advise downtime in a production deployment.

We're currently researching the best way to deploy Magento to production and when it's verified and tested, we'll publish that information here.

If you have input, we'd like to hear from you in [GitHub issue 419](https://github.com/magento/devdocs/issues/419).

Thanks for your patience.
