## Migrate incremental changes
{:.no_toc}

## Overview

Incremental migration enables you to migrate only the changes made in Magento 1 since the last time you migrated data. These changes are:

* data that customers added via storefront (created orders, reviews, changes in customer profiles, etc.)

* all operations with orders in the Magento Admin panel

## Before you start: routine preparations

1. Log in to Magento server as [the file system owner]({{page.baseurl}}install-gde/prereq/file-sys-perms-over.html).

2. Change to the Magento `/bin` directory or make sure it is added to your system PATH.

See the [First steps]({{page.baseurl}}migration/migration-migrate.html#migration-command-run-first) section for more details.

## Run the incremental migration command {#migrate-data-cmd}

To start migrating incremental changes, run:

    bin/magento migrate:delta [-r|--reset] {<path to config.xml>}

where;

* `[-r|--reset]` is an optional argument that starts migration from the beginning. You can use this argument for testing migration.

* `{<path to config.xml>}` is the absolute file system path to `config.xml`; this argument is required.

## Migrate data created by 3rd party extensions

In the `Delta` mode, the Data Migration Tool migrates data created only by Magento's own modules and cannot handle the code or extensions made by third-party developers. If these extensions created data in the storefront database and the merchant wants to have this data in Magento 2 â€” config files of the Data Migration Tool should be created and modified.

See the <a href="{{page.baseurl}}migration/migration-tool-internal-spec.html#delta-migration-mode">Delta migration mode</a> section of the Tool's Internal Specification for more information.
