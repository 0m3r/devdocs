Magento consists of the core product code plus optional components that enhance or replace the core product code. There are over 100 out-of-the-box components available for Magento 2. It is also typical for developers to create new, custom components for their storefront.

This guide provides best practices, guidelines, and tips for creating Magento components, or extensions. Unlike standards, which are processes that have to be followed regardless of the situation, best practices are optional methods or techniques that often yield the best results. We encourage you to follow our best practices when developing code for your Magento components.
