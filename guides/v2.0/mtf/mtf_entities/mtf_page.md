## Page overview {#mtf_page_overview}

A page object is a class that serves as an interface to the Magento page under test.

A page serves as containers for blocks.
To improve the process of working with page elements the mechanism of pages and blocks was implemented in the MTF.
Test uses the methods of the blocks of page object class, when it need to interact with Magento page.
The benefit is that if the UI changes, the tests donâ€™t need to be changed.
Only the code within the block requires changes.

The Page Object Design Pattern provides the following advantages:

- Clean separation between test code and page specific code like locator.
- Single repository for the services or operations required by the page.


This topic learns how to create new page, add blocks to the page, extend the page in another module.
