Question: Don't understand this: "Installation instructions for testing (working around composer repo)", what means "working around composer repo"?

Include info about how users can install the module from <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}comp-mgr/bk-compman-upgrade-guide.html" target="_blank">here</a>, with a pointer to the <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}comp-mgr/compman-new-purchase.html" target="_blank">new component installation</a> topic.
