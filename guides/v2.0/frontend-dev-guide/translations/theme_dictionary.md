<h2>Overview</h2>

This topic gives information about how <a href="{{site.gdeurl}}frontend-dev-guide/translations/#translate_terms">translation dictionaries</a> are used for themes. It also contains practical instructions on generating a dictionary for a theme.

<h2 id="m2devgde-xlate-themes">Why you might need to add a dictionary for a theme</h2>

You might need to add a dictionary for the default language (en_US) in the following cases:

- if you want to replace certain strings from the <a href="{{site.gdeurl}}frontend-dev-guide/themes/theme-inherit.html">parent theme</a>. For example, use "Compare" instead of "Add to Compare" and so on.
- if you want your theme to be ready for localization.
