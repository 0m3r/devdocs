A collection of component technical vision documents describes the desired state of Magento product.
Each individual technical vision relates to a set of modules logically grouped together. Technical vision typically describes component's place in the system, its architecture, extension scenarios and a list of invariants which must be preserved at all times during component refactoring or extension to ensure consistency.
