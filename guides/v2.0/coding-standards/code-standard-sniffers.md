## PHP code sniffers

We recommend the consistent use of <i>code sniffers</i> to enhance the readability of your code and help ensure that it meets Magento code standards.  Although a sniffer will identify many more inconsistencies and errors than a manual edit, we recommend that you manually evaluate and make any fixes after running a sniffer program.  


Magento provides the <a href="https://github.com/magento-ecg/coding-standard.xml" target="_blank">ECG Magento PHP Code Sniffer Coding Standard</a>
for PHP developers. Use this tool to bring your <i>PHP coding style closer to Magento PHP standards</i>. It incorporates the syntax-checking tools that are included in `composer.json` plus more extensive stylistic checks. 



### Additional recommendations

There are many open-source code sniffers that can enhance the readability of your code. Although Magento does not specifically recommend alternative sniffers, community members use the following tools to identify PHP syntax errors:
