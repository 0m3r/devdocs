## Magento DevBox overview
You can now easily use the Magento software with [Docker](https://www.docker.com){:target="_blank"}, a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications. Docker enables us to package the Magento software with all of the parts it needs, such as PHP, a web server, a MySQL database, libraries, and dependencies. 

Magento on Docker is for everyone&mdash;whether you're a Magento newbie, just want to check out Magento, or you're an experienced developer who wants to write custom code. We've designed this release to be primarily for developers but everyone is welcome to check it out.

Because Docker is based on Linux, any custom code you develop will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings on the other machine. Docker enables developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the system that it will ultimately be running on.
