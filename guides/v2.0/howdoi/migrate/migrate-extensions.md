## Migrate extensions from Magento 1 to Magento 2

Magento 1 extensions in most cases will not be compatible with Magento 2 code. Many extension providers offer updated versions of their products available for purchase 
or download on the <a href="https://marketplace.magento.com/extensions.html">Magento Marketplace</a>. Use this chance to review the list of extensions. Install only the extensions 
that are required for your business to make further upgrades easier.
