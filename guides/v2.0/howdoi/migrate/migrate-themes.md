## Migrate theme from Magento 1 to Magento 2

Magento 1 themes cannot be migrated to Magento 2 directly. Following options are available:

* Working with your front-end developer/designer to create a new theme for Magento 2. Use this chance to make sure your site is responsive and follow best practices.
* Installing one of the available themes from the <a href="https://marketplace.magento.com/themes.html">Magento Marketplace</a>.
