<h2 id="install-prereq-overview">Prerequisites for the Component Manager and System Upgrade</h2>
Before you can use the Component Manager and System Upgrade, you must do all of the following:

*	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}comp-mgr/prereq/prereq_updater.html">Set up the Magento Updater application</a>

	The updater synchronizes with Magento Connect and gets the latest versions of all available components. The updater works for both the Component Manager and System Upgrade.
*	<a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}comp-mgr/prereq/prereq_cron.html">Configure cron jobs</a>

	Cron runs every minute to scan for updates.
