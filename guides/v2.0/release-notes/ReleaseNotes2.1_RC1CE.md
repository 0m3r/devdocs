<h2>Magento Community Edition 2.1 Release Candidate 1 (RC1)</h2>

We are pleased to present Magento 2.1 Release Candidate 1 (RC1). This release candidate build is not intended for production purposes. Instead, it provides the development community opportunities to: 

* preview the new features and fixes that Magento 2.1 GA will contain

* contribute to the Magento 2.1 code base by identifying unresolved issues

* test your 2.0 extensions against  2.1 

We welcome your participation in this process! Please file any Community Edition issues on the Community Edition GitHub repository. 

<h3>Highlights</h3>
Magento Community Edition 2.1 includes several new features:


* **PayPal in-context checkout helps to increase conversion rates** by allowing shoppers to pay with PayPal without leaving the merchantâ€™s site. PayPal saved credit card capabilities allow merchants to securely store credit cards with PayPal so shoppers can make future purchases without re-entering their credit card information.
 
* **Braintree enhancements enable merchants to qualify for the simplest set of PCI compliance** requirements by using Braintree Hosted Fields to collect all sensitive card holder information in checkout. Merchants retain complete control over their checkout style and layout because Braintree uses small, transparent iframes to replace individual payment fields. Merchants can now also access Braintree settlement reports from within the Magento Admin.
 
* **Improved management interfaces** make it faster and easier to search for information in the Admin interface, set up global search synonyms, and create new product, category, and CMS content.
