## Preface

This topic provides details about backwards-incompatible changes made in a [Magento CE mainline][] after [Magento 2.0 release][]. The content is auto-generated.

All changes are aggregated into two tables:

- [Class][] that contains breaking changes made to Magento classes
- [Interface][] that contains breaking changes to the Magento interface

where each change is displayed in a separate row in the table, with the following columns:

- **Target** with the name of an affected subject
- **Reason** with the description of a change

{% include changes/ce_changes.html %}
