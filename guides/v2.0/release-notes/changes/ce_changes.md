## Preface

This topic contains up-to-date backward-incompatible changes made in a [Magento CE mainline][] after [Magento 2.0][] release.

All changes are aggregated into two tables:

- [Class][] that contains breaking changes made to Magento classes
- [Interface][] that contains breaking changes to the Magento interface

where each change is a separate entity in a table containing:

- **Level** with type of change:
 - MAJOR is applied when ...
 - MINOR is applied when ...
- **Target** with the name of an affected subject
- **Reason** with description of a change
