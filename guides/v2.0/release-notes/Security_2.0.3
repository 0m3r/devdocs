<h2>Release Notes 2.0.3: Security-Related JIRA issues and APPSECs</h2>

Collaborative workspace for generating descriptions for APPSECs and security-related JIRA issues.  

This content is a work-in-progress. It is for internal use only. 


<h3>MAGETWO-50611/APPSEC-1378</h3>

Many REST APIs that previously granted access to anonymous users can now be configured to require a higher permission level. 


<h3>MAGETWO-50608/APPSEC-1377</h3>
Magento now supports setting limits on password attempts. Previously, Admin and customer token API access did not limit the number of attempts to enter a password, inadvertently allowing brute force attempts to guess passwords


<h3>MAGETWO-48819/APPSEC-1337</h3>
arbitrary PHP code execution


<h3>MAGETWO-45887/APPSEC-1263</h3>
Issues with persistent cross-site scripting have been resolved. Previously, during customer registration on the storefront, a user could provide an email address that contained JavaScript code. Magento now properly validates this email address and executes it in Admin context when viewing the order in the backend



<h3>MAGETWO-47050/APPSEC-1303</h3>



<h3>MAGETWO-50755/APPSEC-1378</h3>


<h3>MAGETWO-/APPSEC-1303</h3>

The encryption keys that are generated in System -> Manage Encryption Key have been strengthened



<h3>Questions</h3>

* Will we be including MAGETWO-48562/APPSEC-1329? If there's a chance we will, let's work on a description.
