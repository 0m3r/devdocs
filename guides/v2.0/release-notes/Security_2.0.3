<h2>Release Notes 2.0.3: Security-Related JIRA issues and APPSECs</h2>

Collaborative workspace for generating descriptions for APPSECs and security-related JIRA issues.  

This content is a work-in-progress. It is for internal use only. 

The release note text is the brief description that we include in the general release notes. The APPSEC description are the longer discussions that we'll post on the Security Center. Ideally, the release-note text is the first sentence or two of the APPSEC discussion.  


<h3>MAGETWO-50611/APPSEC-1378</h3>

Release note: APIs that previously granted access to anonymous users can now be configured to require a higher permission level. 

APPSEC description: Kevin Harper is working on a longer description.


<h3>MAGETWO-50608/APPSEC-1377</h3>
Release note: Magento now supports setting limits on API access password attempts. 

APPSEC description:

Magento now supports setting limits on API access password attempts. Previously, the Admin and Customer Token Access APIs did not limit the number of attempts to have access, inadvertently allowing malicious users could perform brute-force attempts to guess Admin user names and password. 

Fix: 
The Admin and Customer Token Access APIs no longer permit unlimited attempts on username/passwords. 


<h3>MAGETWO-48819/APPSEC-1337</h3>

Release note: Magento now prevents the arbitrary execution of PHP code through the language package CSV file.   

APPSEC description:
Magento now prevents the arbitrary execution of PHP code through the language package CSV file. Previously, a malicious user could add PHP code  into the language package's CSV file by executing 'php bin/magento i18n:collect-phrases -o "lang.csv" -m'.  


<h3>MAGETWO-45887/APPSEC-1263</h3>
Release note: Issue with persistent cross-site scripting through a user account has been resolved. 

APPSEC description:
Issue with persistent cross-site scripting through user account has been resolved. Previously, through customer account on the storefront, a user could provide an email address that contained JavaScript code. Magento now properly escapes output for this email address to avoid execution of this JavaScript on the browser in Admin and Customer accounts context when viewing the order/report.  


<h3>MAGETWO-47050/APPSEC-1303</h3>

Release note: The encryption keys that are generateAPId in **System -> Manage Encryption Key** have been strengthened.

APPSEC description: The encryption keys that are generated in **System -> Manage Encryption Key** have been strengthened. Previously, a malicious user could comparatively easily break these keys because of the usage of a weak hashing algorithm.



<h3>MAGETWO-50755/APPSEC-1379</h3>
