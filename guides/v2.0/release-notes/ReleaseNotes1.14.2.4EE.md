<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<h2>Magento Enterprise Edition 1.14.2.4</h2>

We are pleased to bring to you Magento Enterprise Edition 1.14.2.4, which includes a bundle of patches to improve the security of your Magento installation. While there are no confirmed attacks related to these issues to date, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions.

Important! Use Magento Enterprise 1.14.2.4 or later for all new installations and upgrades to ensure that you have the latest fixes, features, and security updates.



<h2>Security Patch Bundle (SUPEE-7405 v.1.1)</h2>
We highly recommend all users of Magento Enterprise Edition 1.9.0.0 - 1.14.2.3 to either install the SUPEE-7405 1.1 patch bundle, or upgrade to Enterprise Edition 1.14.2.4. You must install the preceding patch (SUPEE-7405 v1.0) *before* you install this patch.  Visit the Magento Security Center for detailed information about the SUPEE-7405 1.1 patch bundle.



<h2>Security Patch Bundle (SUPEE-7978)


<h2>Security Patch Bundle (SUPEE-7822)
The Magento SOAP API now works as expected. Previously, after installation of Patch SUPEE-7405v.0,  an API request would cause a 500 error, and Magento would log an exception.



* If you have not yet installed previous patches, please do so now to bring your system up to date.

* Read or review Magentoâ€™s Security Best Practices and make sure that all safeguards are in place to protect your system from compromise.

* Use this occasion to examine your system for indications of possible attack such as strange administrator accounts, unfamiliar files on the server, etc.

* To receive direct notification from our security team regarding any emerging issues and solutions, sign up for the Security Alert Registry.
