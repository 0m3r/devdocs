<h2>Magento Enterprise Edition 2.1 Release Candidate 3 (RC3)</h2>
We are pleased to present Magento 2.1 Release Candidate 3 (RC3). This release candidate build is not intended for production purposes. Instead, it provides the development community opportunities to: 

* preview the new features and fixes that Magento 2.1 GA will contain

* contribute to the Magento 2.1 code base by identifying unresolved issues

* test your 2.0 extensions against  2.1 

We welcome your participation in this process! Enterprise Edition customers can provide feedback in these two ways: 

* Enterprise Edition GitHub repository.  For more information on how to provide feedback and contribute on GitHub, see <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}contributor-guide/contributing.html" target="_blank">Code contributions</a>. 

* Email to DL-Magento-2.1-Feedback@magento.com.


This Release Candidate is available from `repo.magento.com` if you have an Enterprise Edition license or GitHub  if you have previously signed an agreement to access Magento Enterprise Edition 2.0 beta software on GitHub.


Backward-incompatible changes are documented in <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes-2.1.html" target="_blank">Magento 2.1 Backward Incompatible Changes</a>.

<h3>Highlights</h3>

Magento Enterprise Edition 2.1 includes several new and exciting features:

* **Content Staging and Preview** improves productivity by enabling business teams to easily create, preview, and schedule a wide range of content updates without involving IT. Merchants can make updates to products, categories, CMS content, promotions, and pricing and can preview these changes based on specific dates and times or store views. User-friendly dashboards provide greater visibility into all planned site changes and updates can be automatically deployed at scheduled times.
 
* **Elasticsearch is a next-generation search technology** that is replacing Solr in Magento Enterprise Edition 2.1. It is simpler to set up, able to handle large catalogs, and can easily scale as search volume grows. It supports 33 languages out-of-the-box and merchants can configure stop words and synonyms to ensure high quality search results. 

* **PayPal enhancements** include PayPal in-context checkout and saved credit cards. In-context checkout helps to increase conversion rates 69 bps by allowing shoppers to pay with PayPal without leaving the merchantâ€™s site. PayPal saved credit cards boost repeat purchases by allowing merchants to securely store credit card information with PayPal so customers do not need to re-enter it in checkout or when reordering items from the Admin interface.
 
* **Braintree enhancements enable merchants to qualify for the simplest set of PCI compliance** requirements by using Braintree Hosted Fields to collect all sensitive cardholder information in checkout. Merchants retain complete control over their checkout style and layout because Braintree uses small, transparent iframes to replace individual payment fields. Merchants can now also access Braintree settlement reports from within the Magento Admin interface.
 
* **Improved management interfaces** make it faster and easier to search for information in the Admin, set up global search synonyms, and create new product, category, and CMS content.
