## Content Voice and Tone

Magento Admin’s content is crafted to be read and clearly understood by merchants performing administrative tasks and managing their stores through the Magento software interface. Writers will need to change their tone, depending on the context:

* Most Admin content is instructional and task-oriented. This content should guide merchants through each task with a casual — but direct, professional, and empowering — writing tone.

* Some Magento content is marketing oriented, and this tone is different – writers engage customers with specific value propositions (not fluff) and descriptions that include accurate and tangible benefits.

* Many Admin content types are specific to user interfaces and design patterns – including alt text (image descriptions), button and link labels, contextual help, form content, navigation, and errors and messages. While this tone is more focused on accuracy and brevity than other content the same standards apply: Use clear, plain language and consult global conventions to ensure the content is understood by all.

In all contexts, be sure that you use the correct terms to avoid confusion – when in doubt, consult the [Magento Glossary](https://magento.github.io/glossary/index.html), [Magento Word Usage Bank](https://magento.github.io/glossary/word-usage.html), the [Admin Design Pattern Library]({{page.baseurl}}pattern-library/pattern-library.html), and our external writing references, including:

2.	Microsoft Manual of Style — Content for a worldwide audience (Ch. 3), Accessible content (Ch. 4), Procedures and technical content (Ch. 6)

### Guidelines

**Write casually, but professionally, in gender-neutral language.**

Create a consistent tone of communication that sounds like dialogue, as you would hear it. Here’s a useful tip when creating copy:  Imagine describing the product or task face-to-face with a new marketing employee.

Use contractions for verbs and write sentences with plain, concise language. Never use a long word when a shorter word can be used, and omit unnecessary words.

Content should be gender neutral. To avoid “his” or “her” pronouns, convert singular words to plural words, so you can use “their”, instead.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-tip" markdown="1">
 **No** – "A merchant can update his extensions."
  Yes – "Merchants can update their extensions."
</div>


**Follow accessibility content standards, for users with special needs.**

Use Magento punctuation standards and test your content’s readability.  

On the [Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test](http://www.readabilityformulas.com/free-readability-formula-tests.php]), Magento Admin content should score above 50 (high school level). Test your content here.

**Avoid jargon, slang, and acronyms.**

Words like "optimize", "flexible", and "scalable" might be big, but they’re not clever, unless they're used in accurate context for the appropriate audience.

Avoid terms that may not translate internationally like metaphors, as well as figurative language and humor.

When introducing a term that a merchant may not know, apply a glossary term from the Magento Glossary, provide explanation, or add contextual help. To see what acronyms can be used on first reference, check the Magento Word Usage Bank and AP Stylebook. When in doubt, use the full spelling and add the acronym in parenthesis afterword.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-tip" markdown="1">
  **No** – “Magento is the flexible commerce solution.”
  Yes – “With Magento you can customize everything in your site’s design, ranging from storefront interface to background processes.”

  **No** – “This SaaS feature is only available in Magento Commerce.”
  Yes – “This software-as-a-service (SaaS) feature is only available in Magento Commerce.”
</div>

**Empower the merchant and use active voice.**

Avoid negative sentences constructions to ensure clarity and a positive tone.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-tip" markdown="1">
  **No** – Don’t use negative constructions.
  Yes – Avoid negative constructions.
</div>

Active voice uses the subject-verb-object construction. When you describe an action, start the sentence with the actor – usually the user. Active-voice sentences clarify who is performing an action and they are easier to understand than passive-voice sentences.

Passive voice identifies the recipient (not the source) of the action as the subject of the verb. This is more complicated and less engaging.

Zombie test: If you can put the words “by zombies” after a subject and verb, you’re using passive voice. Example: “Magento is used (by zombies)”

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-tip" markdown="1">
  **No** – “The store address is used to calculate …”
  Yes – “The system uses the store address to calculate ...”
</div>

**Use present tense.**

When a user is reading web content to accomplish a task, these tasks take place in their present, so the present tense is appropriate in most cases.

Additionally, present tense is easier to read than past or future tense.

Use future tense only when it’s necessary to emphasize that something, from the user’s perspective, will occur later.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-tip" markdown="1">
  **No** – A customer will receive an email confirmation after purchase.
  Yes – A customer receives an email confirmation after purchase.
</div>

**Avoid personal pronouns.**

Most websites have eliminated personal pronouns because using “you” and “I” or “your” and “my” can confuse merchants in determining whether content refers to the company or the user.

“You” or “your” may be used in some cases to directly engage merchants in familiar, conversational language.
Avoid using “my”, “we”, “they”, or “I” when referring to merchants or Magento representatives.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-tip" markdown="1">
  **No** – Change your My Account preferences.
  Yes – Change your Account preferences.
  **No** – We will send a confirmation, and you will receive it in 2-3 days.
  Yes – You will receive a confirmation in 2-3 days.
</div>

**Use consistent labels in navigation, tables, forms, and calls to action.**

Wherever content is displayed in data tables and forms, it should be consistent and use global conventions, when available.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-tip" markdown="1">
  Yes – “Continue” button in “Catalog” task flow
  Yes – “Continue” button in “Reports” task flow

  **No** – “Next” button in “Catalog” task flow
  Yes – “Continue” button in “Reports” task flow
</div>

**Write empowering errors and messages that lead to appropriate next steps.**

Take a neutral tone – don’t blame a merchant, use personal pronouns, or in any way indicate that the merchant made a mistake. Use “business casual”, easy-to-understand language, and avoid technical jargon. Content order should appear like this:

1.	Tell merchants what went wrong, in exact terms.
2.	Instruct the user how to fix the problem and continue. If the problem can’t be resolved online, give merchants an appropriate offline contact option and a timeframe when they should try again.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-tip" markdown="1">
  **No** – “You didn’t enter your email address.”
  Yes – “An email address is required. Enter the email address and click “Continue”.”
</div>
