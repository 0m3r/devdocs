This resource provides information on aggregated reports across the Marketplace sites.

As it can be seen, all the endpoints start with **/rest/v1** which will be the mechanism followed to support API versioning. The initial release will be 
set to version 1 (v1). The remaining sections will go over the details of each resource.
