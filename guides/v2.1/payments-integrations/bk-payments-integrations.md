The Payments Integrations guide provides high level view on integration approaches, but not leaving the implementation details, describing components from which any integration can be built.

<p class="q">Need to change wording</p>

These components are:

* [Gateway Command]({{page.baseurl}}payments-integrations/payment-gateway/gateway-command)
* [Gateway Command Pool]({{page.baseurl}}payments-integrations/payment-gateway/command-pool)
* [Request Builder]({{page.baseurl}}payments-integrations/payment-gateway/request-builder)
* [Gateway Client]({{page.baseurl}}payments-integrations/payment-gateway/gateway-client)
* [Response Validator]({{page.baseurl}}payments-integrations/payment-gateway/response-validator)
* [Response Handler]({{page.baseurl}}payments-integrations/payment-gateway/response-handler)
