The [REST API documentation](http://devdocs.magento.com/swagger/index.html) published here on the Magento 2 Developer Documentation website describes the REST APIs that are available on Magento 2.0 Community Edition. (Currently, there are no APIs specific to Enterprise Edition.) This documentation is generated from the code base using [Swagger](http://swagger.io) and represents the state of the code at the time the documentation was generated. However, the REST API documentation is static in that the Magento Developers website is not running an instance of Magento.
