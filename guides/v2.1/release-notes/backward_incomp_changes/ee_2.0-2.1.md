## Preface 

This topic provides details about backward incompatible changes between last commit in the Magento EE 2.1 branch and last commit in the Magento EE 2.0 branch. The content is auto-generated.

Be aware that no @api code has been modified.

All changes are aggregated into two tables:

- [Class](#class) that contains backward incompatible changes made to Magento classes
- [Interface](#interface) that contains backward incompatible changes made to the Magento interfaces

where each change is displayed in a separate row in the table, with the following columns:

- **Target** with the name of an affected class or interface
- **What changed** with the description of a backward incompatible change
