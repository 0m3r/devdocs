## Preface 

This topic provides details about backward incompatible changes between last commit in the [Magento CE 2.1 branch](https://github.com/magento/magento2/tree/2.1) and last commit in the [Magento CE 2.0 branch](https://github.com/magento/magento2/tree/2.0). The content is auto-generated.

Be aware that no @api code has been modified.

All changes are aggregated into two tables:

- [Class](#class) that contains backward incompatible changes made to Magento classes
- [Interface](#interface) that contains backward incompatible changes made to the Magento interfaces

where each change is displayed in a separate row in the table, with the following columns:

- **Target** with the name of an affected class or interface
- **What changed** with the description of a backward incompatible change
