This topic provides details about backward incompatible changes made in {{site.data.var.ce}} 2.1.

All changes are generated automatically using the codebase of corresponding releases in [magento/magento2] repository.
The changes are aggregated into two tables:

- that contains backward incompatible changes made to Magento classes
- that contains backward incompatible changes made to the Magento interfaces

where each change is displayed in a separate row in the table, with the following columns:

- **Class** or **Interface** with the name of an affected class or interface
- **What changed** with the description of a backward incompatible change
