## Magento Enterprise Edition 2.1.1
We are pleased to present Magento Enterprise Edition 2.1.1. This release includes several functional fixes.


Backward-incompatible changes are documented in [Magento 2.1 backward incompatible changes]({{ page.baseurl }}release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes-2.1.html).


### Fixed issues

#### Installation and upgrade


<!--- 55357/53777-->* You can now run `magento setup:upgrade --keep-generated` in production mode.  <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/4795" target="_blank">(GITHUB-4795)</a> 




#### Shopping cart

<!--- 55463/53793 -->* The Minicart Maximum Display Recently Added Item setting now works as expected.  Previously, Magento displayed all the items in the shopping cart, even when the number of items exceeded this limit. <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/4750" target="_blank">(GITHUB-4750)</a> 



#### Miscellaneous


<!--- 55598/54787 -->* You can now successfully place orders when the Enable and Configure Website Payments Standard Payment Action attribute is set to Sale. Previously, under these conditions, Magento would display an error message and not complete the purchase.  <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/4785" target="_blank">(GITHUB-4785)</a> 



<!--- 55466/50026 -->* Attributes of the `salesInvoiceRepository` methods are now more appropriately type cast. (The datatype is now a nullable float.)  Previously, due to the use of an incorrect datatype, Magento would produce an error when calling the `salesInvoiceRepositoryV1GetList` method. <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/3605" target="_blank">(GITHUB-3605)</a> 


<!--- 55462/52448-->* Magento now correctly displays the customer address. Previously, when you selected a default billing address during creation of a new customer account, Magento would not display the address. 



<!--- 55355/54721-->* You can now use Braintree as a payment method when applying reward points or store credit to an order. Previously, you could not access or populate Braintree payment fields if your order included reward points or store credits.



<!--- DELETED: 54804 (won't fix) -->



#### Known issue


The Sales API does not currently support all the update operations on objects that you can execute from the Admin panel. (<i>Objects</i> in this context include orders, invoices, shipments, credit memos, and return merchandise authorizations.)
Â 
The Sales API

* supports create, read, delete, and search operations on objects

* does not support updates to order status or payment status. (<i>Order status</i> includes changes to processing, shipped, processed, and hold, while <i>payment status</i> includes authorized, charged, reject, and refund.)


You can run these operations from the Admin panel.
