## Highlights
Magento 2.1.12 contains almost 50 security fixes and enhancements.  Look for the following highlights in this release:

* **enhancements that help close cross-site request forgery (CSRF), unauthorized data leak, and authenticated Admin user remote code execution vulnerabilities**. See [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-223-2112-and-2018-security-update) for more information.

* **change to Magento Admin to support upcoming USPS shipping changes**. On February 23, 2018, USPS will remove APIs that support the creation of shipping labels without postage. In anticipation of this change, weâ€™ve removed this functionality from the Magento Admin. Consequently, you cannot create and print shipping labels that do not have postage applied.  See Magento Shipping to print USPS shipping labels with postage.

## Security enhancements

Magento 2.1.12 includes multiple security enhancements. Although this release includes these enhancements, no confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions, so we recommend that you upgrade your Magento software to the latest version as soon as possible.

See [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-223-2112-and-2018-security-update) for a comprehensive discussion of these issues.
