<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" markdown="1">

## Highlights

Magento 2.1.7 contains over 15 security enhancements as well as one significant functional enhancement. Look for the following highlights in this release:

* **Support for MasterCard BIN number expansion**. MasterCard recently added a new series of Bank Identification Numbers (BIN), and this release of Magento provides support for transactions made with cards using these new BINs. MasterCard describes the issue [here](https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/issuers/get-support/2-series-bin-expansion.html){:target="_blank"}. 


* **Resolution of multiple high priority and critical security issues**. These critical issues include remote code execution for authenticated Admin users, access control bypass, and cross-site request forgery issues. See [Magento 2.0.14 and 2.1.7 Security Patches](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2014-and-217-security-update){:target="_blank"} for a comprehensive discussion of these issues.
