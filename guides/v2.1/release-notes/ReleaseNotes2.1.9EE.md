We are pleased to present Magento Commerce (formerly Enterprise Edition) 2.1.9. This release includes important enhancements to your Magento software.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" markdown="1">
While there are no confirmed attacks related to these vulnerabilities to date, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. We recommend that you upgrade your existing Magento software to the latest version as soon as possible.
</div>



## Highlights

Magento 2.1.8 contains almost 40 security fixes and enhancements.  Look for the following highlights in this release:

* enhancements that help close cross-site request forgery (CSRF), unauthorized data leak, and authenticated Admin user remote code execution vulnerabilities. See [Magento 2.0.16 and 2.1.9 Security Patches](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2016-and-219-security-update){:target="_blank"} for a comprehensive discussion of these issues. 

* support for changes to the USPS API that USPS implemented on September 1, 2017.



## Fixed issue

Weâ€™ve added support for the change to the USPS API that USPS implemented on September 1, 2017. After installing or upgrading to this release, Magento will display the Domestic rate for USPS, First-Class Mail Parcel as expected. Previously, the USPS First-Class Mail Parcel option was not available after September 1, 2017 on installations running Magento 2.x unless you applied the workaround described [here](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.1/release-notes/tech_bull_USPS-patch-Sept2017.html).
