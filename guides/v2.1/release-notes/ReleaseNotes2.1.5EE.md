We are pleased to present Magento Enterprise Edition 2.1.5. This release includes only one change: an update to our copyright date. 


**This release contains no functional changes**. Updating the copyright to 2017 affects the entire code base, however, which is why we are packaging this simple but pervasive change in its own release. 



## System requirements
Our technology stack is built on PHP and MySQL. For more information, see
