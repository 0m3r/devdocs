*Technical bulletin first published on May 6, 2017.*

These instructions apply to anyone running Magento Community Edition (CE) or Magento Enterprise Edition (EE) version 2.0.x who who will not upgrade to 2.0.14 or later before June 1, 2017. 

### Issue
MasterCard recently added a new series of Bank Identification Numbers (BIN). As of June 1, 2017, MasterCard may fine merchants who do not support cards that use this new range of BIN numbers, and transactions on your store for customers using cards with these new BINs may fail. 

### Action

Upgrade to 2.0.14 or later by June 1, 2017. If that's not possible, download Patch xxx at <a href="https://magento.com/tech-resources/download" target="_blank">Magento Tech Resources</a>.
