## Welcome to the new UI components Guide

This document started as a [week-long doc sprint in Kyiv](http://bhmarks.com/blog/ui-components-doc-sprint-hello-kyiv/){:target="_blank"} with core Magento developers writing documentation about the UI Components. We will add additional topics to this book as we continue our work.

In the meantime, until we have completed this new book, you can also still [access the former (v2.0) UI Components docs](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/ui-components/ui-component.html).

## Overview of UI components
Magento UI components are used to represent distinct UI elements, such as tables, buttons, dialogs, and others. They are designed for simple and flexible user interface (UI) rendering.

Magento UI components are implemented as a standard module named Magento_Ui.

To use UI components in your custom module, you need to add a dependency for the Magento_UI module in [your component's composer.json file]({{page.baseurl}}extension-dev-guide/build/composer-integration.html).

### General structure
In Magento 2 there are basic and secondary UI components.

Basic components are:

* Listing component
* Form component

Secondary components are located in the basic components.

All components can be configured both for Admin and storefront.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
  <p>You need to configure styles manually for components on storefront.</p>
</div>

## What is a UI component?

Magento UI components are used to represent distinct UI elements, such as tables, buttons, dialogs, and others.

UI component is a combination of:

1. **XML declaration** that specifies the component's configuration settings and inner structure.

2. **JavaScript** class inherited from one of the Magento JavaScript framework UI components base classes (such as [UIElement]({{page.baseurl}}ui_comp_guide/concepts/ui_comp_uielement_concept.html), [UIClass]({{page.baseurl}}ui_comp_guide/concepts/ui_comp_uiclass_concept.html) or [UICollection]({{page.baseurl}}ui_comp_guide/concepts/ui_comp_uicollection_concept.html)).


3. **Related template(s)**

### XML Declaration

XML is widely used in Magento 2, which allows developers to easily reuse existing functionalities and add customizations.

Comparing to XML Layouts, UI Components use more semantical approach to declare and configure User Interface.

An instance of UI component is usually based on the hierarchy of child UI components. For example:

* the Form component has Fieldsets, Tabs, and inner fields

* the Listing component has Filters, Columns, Bookmark component, and others

### JavaScript class

The picture below shows how the JavaScript class of a UI component is implemented.

### Templates

A UI component can be bound to one or more HTML templates using the KnockoutJS bindings.

## Using UI component in layout file

Using UI component is as simple as adding the following code to the appropriate layout section:

`<uiÐ¡omponent name="some_ui_component_instance_name"/>`

All UI components have base declaration in [`Magento/Ui/view/base/ui_component/etc/definition.xml`]({{page.baseurl}}ui_comp_guide/concepts/ui_comp_config_flow_concept.html).

UI components configuration reader searches through all active modules and read files:

`<module root dir>/view/<area>/ui_component/etc/definition.xml`

And concrete instances of the components each in separate XML configuration file:

`<module root dir>/view/<area>/ui_component/<component_instance_name>.xml`

### Customization

The following XSD file contains rules and limitations shared between all components (both definitions and instance configurations):

`<your module root dir>/Magento/Ui/etc/ui_definition.xsd`

Extension developers cannot extend this XSD scheme and introduce new components, but can customize existing ones.
