## Welcome to the new UI components Guide

This document started as a [week-long doc sprint in Kyiv](http://bhmarks.com/blog/ui-components-doc-sprint-hello-kyiv/){:target="_blank"} with core Magento developers writing documentation about the UI Components. We will add additional topics to this book as we continue our work.

In the meantime, until we have completed this new book, you can also still [access the former (v2.0) UI Components docs](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/ui-components/ui-component.html).

## Overview of UI components
Magento UI components are used to represent distinct UI elements, such as tables, buttons, dialogs, and others. They are designed for simple and flexible user interface (UI) rendering.

Magento UI components are implemented as a standard module and can be found under `Magento\UI` namespace.

<p class="q">Is it a correct notation, about namespace?</p>

Components are responsible for rendering result page fragments and providing/supporting further interactions of JavaScript components and server.

To use UI components in your custom module, you need to add a dependency for the Magento_UI module in [your component's composer.json file]({{page.baseurl}}extension-dev-guide/build/composer-integration.html).

<p class="q">Do we really need to say this here? cause it's only one of the steps required to use UI components</p>

### General structure
In Magento 2 there are basic and secondary UI components.

Basic components are:

* Listing component
* Form component

Secondary components are located in the basic components.

All components can be configured both for Admin and storefront.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
  <p>You need to configure styles manually for components on storefront.</p>
</div>

### Using UI component in layout file

Using UI component is as simple as adding the following code to the appropriate layout section:

`<uiÐ¡omponent name="some_ui_component_instance_name"/>`

All UI components have base declaration in [`Magento/Ui/view/base/ui_component/etc/definition.xml`]({{page.baseurl}}ui_comp_guide/concepts/ui_comp_config_flow_concept.html).

UI components configuration reader searches through all active modules and read files:

`<module root dir>/view/<area>/ui_component/etc/definition.xml`

And concrete instances of the components each in separate XML configuration file:

`<module root dir>/view/<area>/ui_component/<component_instance_name>.xml`

### Customization

Extension developers cannot introduce new components, but can customize existing ones.

The following XSD file contains rules and limitations shared between all components (both definitions and instance configurations):

`<your module root dir>/Magento/Ui/etc/ui_definition.xsd`

It is possible to create custom component by setting `class`, `component` and `template` parameters of the Container UI component.

<p class="q">in the first sentence of this paragraph we say that extension devs cannot create custom components</p>
