## Welcome to the new UI components Guide

This document started as a [week-long doc sprint in Kyiv](http://bhmarks.com/blog/ui-components-doc-sprint-hello-kyiv/){:target="_blank"} with core Magento developers writing documentation about the UI Components. We will add additional topics to this book as we continue our work.

In the meantime, until we have completed this new book, you can also still [access the former (v2.0) UI Components docs](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/ui-components/ui-component.html).

## Overview of UI components
Magento UI components are used to represent distinct UI elements, such as tables, buttons, dialogs, and others. They are designed for simple and flexible user interface (UI) rendering.

Magento UI components are implemented as a standard module named Magento_Ui.

Components are responsible for rendering result page fragments and providing/supporting further interactions of JavaScript components and server.

To use UI components in your custom module, you need to add a dependency for the Magento_UI module in [your component's composer.json file]({{page.baseurl}}extension-dev-guide/build/composer-integration.html).


### General structure
In Magento 2 there are basic and secondary UI components.

Basic components are:

* Listing component
* Form component

Secondary components are located in the basic components.

All components can be configured both for Admin and storefront.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
  <p>You need to configure styles manually for components on storefront.</p>
</div>

### Using UI component in layout file

Basic components are declared in the page layout files; secondary components are declared in the top-level componentsâ€™ instances configuration files.

### Customization

The following XSD file contains rules and limitations shared between all components (both definitions and instance configurations):

`<your module root dir>/Magento/Ui/etc/ui_definition.xsd`

Extension developers cannot extend this XSD scheme and introduce new components, but can customize existing ones.
