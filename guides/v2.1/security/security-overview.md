We have added security functionality for Magento Open Source, Commerce, and Commerce (Cloud).  These modules enhance access security to protect your Magento instance from  unauthorized access, which can significantly reduce spam.

## Google reCAPTCHA

[Google reCAPTCHA]({{ page.baseurl }}/security/google-recaptcha.html) helps restrict access to the Magento Admin and store to humans only, not robots. It provides enhanced security over Magento CAPTCHA with additional benefits including Invisible reCAPTCHA.

You will need to install the extension using Composer for v2.1 and v2.2. Installations and upgrades of v2.3 include reCAPTCHA.

## Two-Faction Authentication

[Two-Factor Authentication]({{ page.baseurl }}/security/two-factor-authentication.html)(2FA) adds support for software authentication apps and hardware authentication devices including Google Authenticator, Authy, U2F devices, and Duo Security. It provides additional security by requiring a second step to verify access through an entered code or push request.

You will need to install the extension using composer for v2.1 and v2.2. Installations and upgrades of v2.3 include 2FA.
