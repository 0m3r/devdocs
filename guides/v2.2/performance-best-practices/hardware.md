## CPU

Magento web nodes serve all requests that were not cached or canâ€™t be cached through the complete launch of the application. One CPU core can serve around 2 (sometimes up to 4) Magento requests effectively. This leads us to necessity of putting sufficient number of web nodes/cores for processing all incoming requests without putting them into queue:

**Questions to reviewer:**

1. What are the "N"s in the following equation? They don't seem to be a constant.

  `N(Cores) = N(Expected Requests) / 2 + N (Expected Cron Processes)`

2. Is right side of the equation

```
Expected requests
________________
2 + Expected Cron Processes
```

or

```
Expected requests
________________  +  Expected Cron Processes
      2
```

If a store expects changing load, the number of web nodes/cores can be increased manually for an active sales period. Alternatively, an auto-scaling model can be used for automatically extending web tiers.

## Memory

The Magento 2 database (as well as any other database) is sensitive to amount of the memory available for storing data and indexes. To allow effective leveraging of MySQL data indexation, the amount of memory should be at least close to half size of data stored in the database.

## Network bandwidth

Sufficient network bandwith is one of the key requirements for data exchange between web nodes, database(s), caching/session servers, and other services. Because Magento 2 effectively leverages caching for high performance, your system can actively exchange data with caching servers like Redis. If Redis is located on a remote server, it is necessary to provide a sufficient network channel between web nodes and the caching server so that there is no bottleneck on read/write operations.
