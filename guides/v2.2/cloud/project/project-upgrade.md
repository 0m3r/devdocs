This information details how to upgrade {{site.data.var.ece}} to 2.2.X from any version, and upgrading to new 2.2.X versions.

When you upgrade {{site.data.var.ece}}, you also upgrade with patches and available hotfixes as part of the `magento-cloud-metapackage`. Make sure you have `auth.json` in your project root folder if there isnâ€™t one already.

Our upgrades are Composer driven. For more information on Composer, see [Composer in Cloud]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/reference/cloud-composer.html).

When upgrading  from 2.1.X to 2.2.X, please see [Upgrade from 2.1.X](#2-1-X).

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" markdown="1">
Always apply and test a patch your local system in an active branch. You can push and test in an Integration environment prior to deploying across all environments.
</div>

## Upgrade from 2.1.X {#old-version}
When upgrading from 2.1.X, you need to complete additional preparation steps. These include:

* [Configuration Management](#config): Create a new `config.php` using the `config.local.php` to properly upgrade
* [.magento.app.yaml](#magento-app-yaml): Update the file with new settings and required changes for hooks and environment variables

### Configuration Management and upgrading {#config}
If you are upgrading from 2.1.X to 2.2.X and use Configuration Management, you need to add another configuration file to your branch. Previous versions with Configuration Management uses a `config.local.php` file. Starting with 2.2.0, [Configuration Management and Pipeline Deployment](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/cloud/live/sens-data-over.html) use a different file name: `config.php`. When you upgrade without having this file prepared, you will receive an error and a list of steps to complete prior to upgrade.

We recommend completing the following steps to upgrade without errors:
1. Create a copy of `config.local.php` and name it `config.php`. You should add this file in the `app/etc` folder.
2. Git add and commit the file to your branch.
3. Push the file to your Integration branch and environment.

You can now upgrade to 2.2.X. After upgrading, you can remove the `config.php` file and regenerate it correctly for your implementation. This file works exactly as `config.local.php`, with supportive additions and a different name.

### Update .magento.app.yaml {#magento-app-yaml}
If you are upgrading from 2.1.X to 2.2.X, you need to also update your [.magento.app.yaml](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/cloud/project/project-conf-files_magento-app.html) or you will encounter errors. {{site.data.var.ece}} 2.2.X has new settings in the file.

1. Locate and edit your `.magento.app.yaml` in your Git branch.
2. For the PHP version, make sure it is 7.0: `type: php:7.0`
3. We have updated our build and deploy hooks. Locate the `hooks` section, and update the following:

        hooks:
          # We run build hooks before your application has been packaged.
          build: |
              php ./vendor/bin/m2-ece-build
          # We run deploy hook after your application has been deployed and started.
          deploy: |
              php ./vendor/bin/m2-ece-deploy
4. Enter the following environment variables to the end of your file:

        variables:
          env:
            CONFIG__DEFAULT__PAYPAL_ONBOARDING__MIDDLEMAN_DOMAIN: 'payment-broker.magento.com'
            CONFIG__STORES__DEFAULT__PAYMENT__BRAINTREE__CHANNEL: 'Magento_Enterprise_Cloud_BT'
            CONFIG__STORES__DEFAULT__PAYPAL__NOTATION_CODE: 'Magento_Enterprise_Cloud'
5. Save the file and push to your Git branch.

**For Pro plan merchants:** When you are ready to deploy to Pro Staging and Production environments, you must enter a [Support ticket]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/bk-cloud.html#gethelp) advising you need your hooks updated for {{site.data.var.ece}} 2.2.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" markdown="1">
**For Pro: **You may encounter deployment errors for Pro to your Staging and Production environments if the hooks are not updated. Please enter a [Support ticket]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/bk-cloud.html#gethelp) advising you need your hooks updated in Staging and Production for {{site.data.var.ece}} 2.2.
</div>

## Back up the database {#backup-db}
We recommend that you first back up the database of the system you are upgrading. Use the following steps to back up your Integration, Staging, and Production environments.

Back up your Integration environment database and code:

1.  Enter the following command to make a local backup of the remote database:

        magento-cloud db:dump
2.  Enter the following command to back up code and media:

        php bin/magento setup:backup --code [--media]

    You can optionally omit `[--media]` if you have a large number of static files that are already in source control.

Back up your staging or production system database:

1.  [SSH to the server]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/env/environments-ssh.html).
2.  Find the database login information:

        php -r 'print_r(json_decode(base64_decode($_ENV["MAGENTO_CLOUD_RELATIONSHIPS"]))->database);'

3.  Create a database dump:

        mysqldump -h <database host> --user=<database user name> --password=<password> --single-transaction <database name> | gzip - > /tmp/database.sql.gz

## Verify other changes {#verify-changes}
Verify other changes you're going to submit to source control before you start the upgrade:

1.  If you haven't done so already, change to your project root directory.
2.  Enter the following command:

        git status
3.  If there are changes you do *not* want to submit to source control, branch or stash them now.

## Complete the upgrade {#upgrade}

1.  Change to your Magento base directory and enter the following command:

        composer require magento/magento-cloud-metapackage <requiredversion> --no-update
        composer update

    For example, to upgrade to version 2.1.4:

        composer require magento/magento-cloud-metapackage 2.1.4 --no-update
        composer update

4.  Add, commit, and push your changes to initiate a deployment:

        git add -A
        git commit -m "Upgrade"
        git push origin <branch name>

    `git add -A` is required to add all changed files to source control because of the way Composer marshals base packages. Both `composer install` and `composer update` marshal files from the base package (that is, `magento/magento2-base` and `magento/magento2-ee-base`) into the package root.

    The files Composer marshals belong to the new version of Magento, to overwrite the outdated version of those same files. Currently, marshaling is disabled in Magento Commerce, so you must add the marshaled files to source control.

5.  Wait for deployment to complete.

6.  [Verify your upgrade](#upgrade-verify).

## Verify your upgrade {#upgrade-verify}
This section discusses how to verify your upgrade and to troubleshoot any issues you might find.

To verify the upgrade in your integration, staging, or production system:

1.  [SSH to the server]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/env/environments-ssh.html).
2.  Enter the following command from your Magento root directory to verify the installed version:

        php bin/magento --version

## Troubleshoot your upgrade {#upgrade-verify-tshoot}
In some cases, an error similar to the following displays when you try to access your storefront or the Magento Admin in a browser:

    There has been an error processing your request
    Exception printing is disabled by default for security reasons.
      Error log record number: <error number>

### View error details on the server
To view the error in your integration system, [SSH to the server]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/env/environments-ssh.html) and enter the following command:

    vi /app/var/report/<error number>

### Resolve the error
One possible error occurs when the deployment hook failed, and therefore the database has not yet been fully upgraded. If so, an error similar to the following is displayed:

    a:4:{i:0;s:433:"Please upgrade your database: Run "bin/magento setup:upgrade" from the Magento root directory.
    The following modules are outdated:
    Magento_Sales schema: current version - 2.0.2, required version - 2.0.3

To resolve the error:

1.  [SSH to the server]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/env/environments-ssh.html).
2.  [Examine the logs]({{ page.baseurl }}cloud/trouble/environments-logs.html) to determine the source of the issue.
3.  After you fix the source of the issue, push the change to the server, which causes the upgrade to restart.

    For example, on a local branch, enter the following commands:

        git add -A && git commit -m "fixed deployment failure" && git push origin <branch name>

### Deployment error {#deploy-error}
If you encounter a deployment error to Pro Staging and Production environments, you need to have us update your `.magento.app.yaml` hooks. Please enter a [Support ticket]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/bk-cloud.html#gethelp) advising you need your hooks updated in Staging and Production for {{site.data.var.ece}} 2.2.

## Additional upgrades
We strongly recommend upgrading yoru Fastly module to v1.2.28 or later.
