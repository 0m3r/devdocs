## Fixes and enhancements


### Installation, setup, and deployment
<!--- MAGETWO-86496 -->* The magento backup command fails under magento 2.2.1. There was no such issue under magento 2.1.8. They are no errors in the database log. Previously, an issue with the database backup process caused the backup process to fail.  *Fix submitted by [Jagriti Joshi](https://github.com/jagritijoshi) in pull request 13066*. [GitHub-12877](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12877)


<!--- MAGETWO-86045 -->* Some of the links insode theMagento installer to magento installation documentation devdocs are outdated. This PR fixes this within progress.phtml. *Fix submitted by [Jonas HÃ¼nig](https://github.com/jonashrem) in pull request 12857*.


<!--- MAGETWO-84506 -->* Add command `app:config:status` to check whether config propagation is up to date. This command can be used to decide whether `app:config:import` execution is needed during deployments. On version 2.2 a new command `setup:db:status` was added to decide whether executing `setup:upgrade` is required. The purpose of this command was to add the possibility of deploying without executing `setup:upgrade` if module versions are up to date.
With the same objective, a command to check the config status is needed to decide whether `app:config:import` is needed.

*Issue*
If `setup:upgrade` is not executed, we need to always execute `app:config:import` because there is no way to know, if config files are up to date or not. This will mean, we still need to set the maintenance and we cannot simply switch the code to the new version. enhancement *Fix submitted by [Juan Alonso](https://github.com/jalogut) in pull request 12441*.


<!--- MAGETWO-84125 -->* When we start setup:rollback wrong name file was used. Now it is valid. Previously, database roll out failed.  *Fix submitted by [Roman K.](https://github.com/RomaKis) in pull request 12108*. [GitHub-12064](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12064)

<!--- MAGETWO-84081 -->* ideally you'd be able to grant users access without giving them full rights. For 3rd party integrators for example. Previously, It's currently not possible to set access to Integrations (API access) for Admin roles. They are only available when Role Resources is set to all [GitHub-9684](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9684)

<!--- MAGETWO-81841 -->* Create CLI command which will make possible to enable/disable Magento Profiler. Provide a description of the changes proposed in the pull request. Adjusted `app/bootstrap.php` to have it read out the flagfile `var/profiler.flag` to enable the profiler and added CLI commands to create and remove the file. [GitHub-9277](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9277)



<!--- MAGETWO-81740 -->* Changed side-menu.phtml to have naming in line with the naming in home.phtml. Component was the name in prior to Magento 2.2
Updated the less files to reflect these changes and switched the icons in the menu. The Icons for "Extension Manager" and "Module Manager" are inconsistent in the main content area and left-hand menu of the Web Setup Wizard.

Updated compiled setup.css file. *Fix submitted by [Danny Verkade - Cream](https://github.com/dverkade) in pull request 11388*. [GitHub-11236](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11236)


<!--- MAGETWO-80111 -->*  Keep maintenance mode on if it was previously enabled. When enabling maintenance mode it will get disabled after using one of the following commands:
`bin\magento module:uninstall`
`bin\magento setup:backup`
`bin\magento setup:rollback`
`bin\magento theme:uninstall`
`bin\magento deploy:mode:set production`
The changes in this PR will first check or maintenance mode was already enabled. If so, it will skip disabling maintenance mode after executing the command.

*Fix submitted by [Joke Puts](https://github.com/jokeputs) in pull request 11052*. [GitHub-9918](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9918) 

 
<!--- MAGETWO-85778 -->* Match flexible static file version in nginx sample config. Magento 2.2 allows you to specify a custom version for static files being deployed. That means it may not necessarily be numeric like it is when using the default timestamp version numbers. This generalizes the nginx sample config to match custom versions as well. *Fix submitted by [Scott Buchanan](https://github.com/scottsb) in pull request 12521*. 



<!--- MAGETWO-85274 -->* Update CrontabManager.php If crontab is already populated, 'php bin/magento cron:install' adds '#~ MAGENTO START' and the rest of code directly to the last row of crontab without any spaces. *Fix submitted by [Michele Fantetti](https://github.com/WaPoNe) in pull request*.



<!--- MAGETWO-85744 -->*  Composer does not check availability of the "bcmath" php module. But Magento framework uses "bccomp" function in getBatchSize method of the Magento\Framework\DB\FieldDataConverter class. *Fix submitted by [Mobecls](https://github.com/Mobecls) in pull request 12768*.



<!--- MAGETWO-88149 -->* Remove forced setting of cache_lifetime to false in constructor and set default cache_lifetime to 3600
In investigating the issue it was found that the footer block does not have a cache lifetime set and it also has code in its constructor to set the cache lifetime to false. This pull request removes the forcing of cache lifetime to false and sets the default value to 3600 as done so in the \Magento\Theme\Block\Html\Topmenu block. *Fix submitted by [Barry vd. Heuvel](https://github.com/zolat) in pull request 13762*.


<!--- MAGETWO-87975 -->* Add option to add IP address to existing list *Fix submitted by [zolat](https://github.com/barryvdh) in pull request 13586*.




<!--- MAGETWO-87900 -->*  Add option "lock-config" for shell command "config:set" In most cases, configuration settings should be shared among all development, staging and live instances of a shop. To achieve this, you can use the same mechanism as with the --lock switch described in http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-config-mgmt-set.html.

The only difference is that the configuration values will be stored in app/etc/config.php instead of app/etc/env.php. This file should usually be included in the VCS and thus shared between instances.
*Fix submitted by [Andreas von Studnitz](https://github.com/avstudnitz) in pull request 13280*.



<!--- MAGETWO-87859 -->*  Show redirect_to_base config in store scope. *Fix submitted by [Jeroen](https://github.com/JeroenVanLeusden) in pull request 13614*.


<!--- MAGETWO-87856 -->*  Added ability deploying static content on demand in production mode. As a merchant, I want static content to be generated on the fly, so my store's downtime is lower and cache can handle the loads. 

Improved "Production Mode" to support SC generation on the fly is implemented
possibility to turn ON/OFF this generation SC in production mode.

enhancement




<!--- MAGETWO-87838 -->* Show maintenance IP-address without commas 

When looking at existing IP-address for the maintenance status, they are shown with commas. But when setting them, commas are not accepted. This is a pretty trivial change, but makes it easier to copy, modify and paste the list of IP-addresses. *Fix submitted by [Barry vd. Heuvel](https://github.com/barryvdh) in pull request 13587*.





<!--- MAGETWO-87744 -->* Ensure DeploymentConfig Reader always returns an array. When a empty configuration file is ready, this could result in loading invalid configuration, for example,  just `1` instead of an array. This will lead to problems with other code, expecting a valid array. *Fix submitted by [Barry vd. Heuvel](https://github.com/barryvdh) in pull request 13584*.




<!--- MAGETWO-83782 -->*   Cron_schedule forever increasing in size. Lots of pending jobs never cleared. The size of cron_schedule table is constantly increasing every minute. The majority of the jobs are in the pending state. Some are marked as success. The cronjob steadily increases in the time taken to complete, at the moment it is taking around 30 seconds to complete, during which time, mysql and php are taking up heavy CPU usage.

A MYSQL query log shows Magento churning through all the pending requests, but they are never marked as success. Hence the ever increasing list of jobs to run. [GitHub-11002](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11002) 




<!--- MAGETWO-82288 -->* Add MagentoStyle as Console Input/output helper object 

..to allow easier access to io helpers in symfony/console

Description
Gives a helper object to access styling objects in symfony console easier. *Fix submitted by [Wesley Guthrie](https://github.com/wesleywmd) in pull request 11504*.


### Bundle 
<!--- MAGETWO-86022 -->* Fix notice during Update Bundle Product without changes. If we need to update (not new) bundle product and edit any Bundle Items then the saving process works fine.
If we assign a new category and image to the product then the saving process doesn't work.

<!--- MAGETWO-81942 -->* A solution for Product Repeat Issue after filter on category listing page.
I have traced the issues and finally, I have found the problem. This issues magento/magento2#11139 is occurring just because of product position. When some products position are same on collection at that time we have faced this issue.

Actual result
Product is assigned to all websites even though I didn't explicitly send any website associations

<!--- MAGETWO-83399 -->* This solution solves the issue when you want to not have toolbar block set on product listing. The reason why toolbar persisted even after that was explicit removed from layout configuration, it's because the method Magento\Catalog\Block\Product\ListProduct:getToolbarBlock always returns a toolbar block.

Cannot remove product_list_toolbar in XML

Expected result
The toolbar should be removed from the product list pages.
Actual result
The toolbar remains on the page

<!--- MAGETWO-84087 -->* Can't add customizable options to product

If you add custom tab with a name "options" to product form via attribute set, data-index for this tab and options from custom-options will be the same, so I changed targetName from index to name.

Expected result
It should just skip the offending file, and/or update the log file to indicate which/where the problematic file resides.

<!--- MAGETWO-86662 -->* Adding 'is_saleable' attribute to sort of product collection causes exception and adding 'is_salable' has no effect. 
[GitHub-7768](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/7768)

n Magento\Catalog\Model\ResourceModel\Product\Collection, addAttributeToSort() has the following lines:

        } elseif ($attribute == 'is_saleable') {
            $this->getSelect()->order("is_saleable " . $dir);
            return $this;
        }
But the generated SQL query selects stock_status_index.stock_status as 'is_salable', not 'is_saleable'. So adding 'is_saleable' causes an SQL exception and since 'is_salable' is not a product attribute, it silently fails to be added to the SQL statement.

*Fix submitted by [Nickolas Malyovanets](https://github.com/nmalevanec) in pull request 1045*. 

Expected result
The product stock_status is included in the query sort clause.
Actual result
Exceptions:

<!--- MAGETWO-82949 -->* Product's are linked to categories without notice of any website. The visual merchandiser shows to lowest price of in stock and active simples that are associated with the configurable. The stock check ignores the website scope so if a simple is in stock on the website level but out of stock on default level it should been ignored to determine the lowest price. This commit fixes that issue.

Before the fix:

The price of the out of stock simple product was shown.
After the fix:

The price '0,00' is shown.

Visual Merchandiser show prices of out of stock simple products for the associated configurable product

updateCart.phtml vs addtocart.phtml

This PR matches both updatecart.phtml and addtocart.phtml qty input validators. Now when you target, afterGetQuantityValidators it will apply to both inputs.

<!--- MAGETWO-86154 -->* Wrong page cached for logged in user	
X-Magento-Vary & PHPSESSID now have the same expiration time

Partner reported that Cookie X-Magento-Vary has expiration "Session" - which means it is not considered expired until the browser is closed.
Cookie PHPSESSID has finite expiration time (not Session) - by default 1 hour. The conflict arises when PHPSESSID cookie is already expired, but "X-Magento-Vary" cookie is still valid. In that case if Varnish storage is empty, it will request the backend (Magento) and get the content for not logged in user (because PHPSESSID is expired), but cache it for logged in user (because X-Magento-Vary is not expired).

The following callback is created by passing an array that consists of an object and a string. The method of that object will be used in the callback, and each model in the collection will be passed to the method as the first parameter. While this results in a successful callback, the doc block of the walk method of a collection incorrectly reports that it will only accept a string, while the following example uses an array.

<!--- MAGETWO-83401 -->* Fix depends field not working for radio elements #

Currently the `<depends>` field only works when used on elements of `select` type, this PR aims to replicate the same functionality for fields with `radios` type.

<depends> field doesn't work in system.xml for "radios" fields

In system.xml file a field can depend on another field value; it will be shown or not depending from previous field choice.
It works fine if the field depends on a "select" field but if you try to use a "radios" field dependency the mechanism doesn't work and the field will always be shown.

Expected result
discount_calculation value = 'automatic' => discount_category is shown
discount_calculation value = 'manual' => discount_category is not shown
Actual result
discount_category is always shown so is not working
If I declare discount_calculation field as "select" type, all works fine

When you enter the first time a xml with CDATA it works as expected. After saving the CDATA tag is gone. 

The CDATA tag is added in the database field, so it gets stripped when they view is outputting the code from the database.
A CDATA section cannot contain the string "]]>" and therefore it is not possible for a CDATA section to contain nested CDATA sections. The preferred approach to using CDATA sections for encoding text that contains the triad "]]>" is to use multiple CDATA sections by splitting each occurrence of the triad just before the ">"

The form email input field selector at the "password-strength-indicator.js" is generic enough to match any input field "email" in the frontend at that time. This causes the password strength indicator to work in the password reset email screen in the default theme, given that this selector ends up matching the email field of the newsletter subscription form.

However, if you are using a theme in which the newsletter subscription email form is removed, it then causes this password strength validation to break. Moreover, it doesn't make much sense to compare your password with any possible email that is written in the newsletter subscription form.

<!--- MAGETWO-84764 -->* NewRelic: Disables Module Deployments, Creates new Deploy Marker Command 
*Fix submitted by [Kristof](https://github.com/fooman) in pull request 12477*. 

The "report module enable/disable changes as deployment markers" functionality in the Magento_NewRelicReporting module is broken. Irrespective of actual module enabling/disabling, if New Relic's cron is enabled Magento will send a New Relic Deployment markers for every enabled module once per cron period. This is for an hourly cron and an average of 100 modules in a module system, this is approximatly 2,400 event per individual Magento cron server, per day. This is flooding New Relic's systems with -- let's call it a lot -- of traffic. New Relic is taking steps to drop these deployment requests, but they're still a burden on the system. Also, this creates an almost unusable deployment feature in the New Relic UI. Finally, this creates slow running cron and needless network traffic for individual Magento systems.

Debug logs are being written, exception logs not.

<!--- MAGETWO-75840 -->* Magento now shows all products as expected in the Recently Ordered list when you place an order that contains products from multiple stores.

Loads the invoice by id on getInvoice if an invoice ID is set on the credit memo

[GitHub-11669](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11669)


Expected result
Because I'm refunding an invoice, I'd expect the invoice ID to be saved on the credit memo.
When I create a credit memo from the invoice in the admin pages, the invoice ID is saved on the credit memo




<!--- MAGETWO-83740 -->* 

Credit memos can have the state open: `\Magento\Sales\Model\Order\Creditmemo::STATE_OPEN`.
This means that it is possible to have a creditmemo with an ID which still has to be refunded.
I'm creating a module that introduces a validation step for refund payments before the actual refund can take place. It uses the open state of credit memos to wait for approval and then refunds the creditmemo. Right now the credit memo is not refundable once it has an ID. I think this is incorrect in case of open credit memos.

Even existing credit memos should be refundable if their state is open #11550


<!--- MAGETWO-83783 -->* The `Magento\Sales\Service\V1\OrderCreateTest` test now has the correct shipping method fixture. Previously, this test contained an incorrect shipping method fixture, which produced an error whenever an order's shipping method is treated an object.
 #12227


<!--- MAGETWO-84219 -->* When you use the REST API to create a credit memo, Magento now sends  credit memo update emails as expected. Previously, under these circumstances, Magento did not send this email, and no other transaction emails were sent ot the customer.

*Fix submitted by [Roman K.](https://github.com/RomaKis) in pull request*. 

[GitHub-12560](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12560)


Expected result
Address Country drop-down in Admin should take values from 'Allow Countries' setting configured for the Website Store View where that order was made (e.g.: for German store with id = 7)
Actual result
But it's picking the 'Allow Countries' from first store View (with id=1).
If before steps 3 and 4 from "Steps to reproduce" go to Admin > Sales > Create New Order and when creating it select some different Store View (e.g.: Italian, with id = 10) then actual result after "Steps to reproduce" will show allowed countries for that selected Store View (with id = 10, if continue on example).







<!--- MAGETWO-85660 -->* The \Magento\Sales\Model\Order\Pdf\AbstractPdf::drawLineBlocks method now works as expected.

Previously, Paypal cannot place the order when Payment Action = Order. 

ACTUAL RESULTS:
"We cant place order" error shows
../var/log/support_report.log contains:

DETAILS:

When PayPal is set to Authorize mode, the order can be placed successfully.
However, when mode is changed to Order, upon reaching Review page and clicking Place Order, the page refreshes and an error is displayed: "We can't place the order."
I was able to replicate it in clean magento. If Payment action is set to Authorize, it goes through. If Payment Action is set to Order, it gives the error. I didnt check the other payment action Sale. But it is only in Order where you have to enter Merchant ID. Not sure if that's connected to the issue or not.
ADDITIONAL NOTES FROM MERCHANT:

They have an external ERP system that needs to perform the authorization
Magento needs to omit the auth when placing an order on the site so it can be done later by the ERP (ERP APIs don't allow to insert a record based on previously created auth)





<!--- MAGETWO-86258 -->* The cancel order and restore quote methods now accurately calculate the amount of stock to be returned to inventory when an order is canceled.

*Fix submitted by [Ievgen Sentiabov](https://github.com/joni-jones) in pull request 12902*.

/js/action/set-payment-method` to use the `Magento_Checkout/js/action/set-payment-information` so the additional payment/checkout data is correctly added.
Magento 2.2 Paypal Can't Accept Checkout Agreements Before Routing to PayPal 

This could potentially be a module conflict, but after stepping through and inspecting the checkout code I can't find any obvious third-party interference.

When going through standard checkout and selecting PayPal Express at the payment step, there is an agreements checkbox present. However, checking this box does nothing as the agreements data is not parsed and passed to the set-payment-information API. This triggers the CheckoutAgreements validation plugin which fails to validate with no agreements data.

When I override the PayPal JS to add the agreements data to the paymentData before sending to the API, it passes validation but then fails because PayPal doesn't allow setting extension data.

During currency switch notice message shows wrong calculation of minimum order amount.


This is about notice message of min order amount on cart page.When we have set min order amount and on cart page someone change currency, user see same amount and only currency symbol changed. It should recalculate amount also.
Instead of currency convert, we use price helper then it gives us re calculated price amount in notice message.

*Fix submitted by [Fabian Schmengler](https://github.com/schmengler) in pull request 12359*.

This PR adds a `--no-update` flag for sampledata commands. It will be passed to composer, so that the user can add and remove sampledata modules without automatic `composer update`. This way, the actual update can be postponed to a manual composer execution. It gives the developer more control and is especially useful in scenarios where running composer from within bin/magento results in permission issues.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
The product should still be activated in only one website at the end of the scheduled update event.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
The product is incorrectly activated for all websites when the scheduled update event ends.

2. Create an admin role that does not have access to orders and an admin user assigned to that role
3. Login as the user created in the step above
4. Search for something in the admin global search.
Expected result
I should see the links to " keywords in Products", " keywords in Customers", " keywords in Pages" only and translated in the selected language.
I should see results for products, pages and customers matching my keywords (this actually works).

Actual result
I see the link "keywords in Orders" that I should not see because I don't have access to orders. Clicking it takes me to an "Access denied" page.

<!--- MAGETWO-85291 -->* Can bypass Minimum Order Amount Logic 

*Fix submitted by [Roman K.](https://github.com/RomaKis) in pull request 963*. 


Can bypass Minimum Order Amount Logic


Steps to reproduce
Enable Minimum Order Amount in system config. (Store / Configuration / Sales / Sales / Minimum Order Amount Enable = Yes)
Add products to the cart until you are over min amount.
Click on cart and click on "View and Edit Cart"
Click "Check Out with Multiple Addresses" on right side of page
Remove few product from order, while sum of order will be less than in settings (min order amount)
Then click "Update Qty & Addresses"
And finish order.
Expected result
When hitting the Place Order button would expect to see error about min order.
Actual result
Order goes through just fine.
Again, the theme must have the minicart visible during checkout and must allow for removing product.

### User interface

<!--- MAGETWO-71936 -->* Error: Invalid input datetime format of value "'DD/MM/+********"'

[GitHub-10485](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10485)


Steps to reproduce
Login to Magento admin
Open an existing product for edit
Click save
Expected result
Product is saved successfully as no changes are made from the previous state of the product
Actual result
An error Invalid input datetime format of value '25/07/+00201717' appears and the product is not saved
This issue happened when I upgrade from 2.1.7 to 2.1.8. Some products seems to be able to save without an issue but majority of the ones I tried has this error with various values for the actual date.





### URL rewrites
