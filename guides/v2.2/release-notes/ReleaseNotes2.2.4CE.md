## Fixes and enhancements


### Installation, setup, and deployment
<!--- MAGETWO-86496 -->* The magento backup command fails under magento 2.2.1. There was no such issue under magento 2.1.8. They are no errors in the database log. Previously, an issue with the database backup process caused the backup process to fail.  [GitHub-12877](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12877) @jagritijoshi Jagriti Joshi https://github.com/jagritijoshi PR13066


<!--- MAGETWO-86045 -->* Some of the links insode theMagento installer to magento installation documentation devdocs are outdated. This PR fixes this within progress.phtml. PR 12857 @jonashrem Jonas HÃ¼nig https://github.com/jonashrem

<!--- MAGETWO-84506 -->* Add command `app:config:status` to check whether config propagation is up to date. This command can be used to decide whether `app:config:import` execution is needed during deployments. On version 2.2 a new command `setup:db:status` was added to decide whether executing `setup:upgrade` is required. The purpose of this command was to add the possibility of deploying without executing `setup:upgrade` if module versions are up to date.
With the same objective, a command to check the config status is needed to decide whether `app:config:import` is needed.

*Issue*
If `setup:upgrade` is not executed, we need to always execute `app:config:import` because there is no way to know, if config files are up to date or not. This will mean, we still need to set the maintenance and we cannot simply switch the code to the new version.

They are only available when Role Resources is set to all [GitHub-9684](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9684)

<!--- MAGETWO-81841 -->* Create CLI command which will make possible to enable/disable Magento Profiler

Provide a description of the changes proposed in the pull request -->
Adjusted `app/bootstrap.php` to have it read out the flagfile `var/profiler.flag` to enable the profiler and added CLI commands to create and remove the file. [GitHub-9277](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9277)

<!--- MAGETWO-81740 -->* Changed side-menu.phtml to have naming in line with the naming in home.phtml. Component was the name in prior to Magento 2.2
Updated the less files to reflect these changes and switched the icons in the menu. The Icons for "Extension Manager" and "Module Manager" are inconsistent in the main content area and left-hand menu of the Web Setup Wizard.

<!--- MAGETWO-80111 -->*  Keep maintenance mode on if it was previously enabled. When enabling maintenance mode it will get disabled after using one of the following commands:
`bin\magento module:uninstall`

`bin\magento setup:rollback`
`bin\magento theme:uninstall`
`bin\magento deploy:mode:set production`
The changes in this PR will first check or maintenance mode was already enabled. If so, it will skip disabling maintenance mode after executing the command.

Magento 2.2 allows you to specify a custom version for static files being deployed. That means it may not necessarily be numeric like it is when using the default timestamp version numbers. This generalizes the nginx sample config to match custom versions as well.

This pull request removes the forcing of cache lifetime to false and sets the default value to 3600 as done so in the \Magento\Theme\Block\Html\Topmenu block.

<!--- MAGETWO-87900 -->*  Add option "lock-config" for shell command "config:set"

In most cases, configuration settings should be shared among all development, staging and live instances of a shop. To achieve this, you can use the same mechanism as with the --lock switch described in http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-config-mgmt-set.html.

The only difference is that the configuration values will be stored in app/etc/config.php instead of app/etc/env.php. This file should usually be included in the VCS and thus shared between instances.

<!--- MAGETWO-83782 -->*   Cron_schedule forever increasing in size. Lots of pending jobs never cleared

The size of cron_schedule table is constantly increasing every minute. The majority of the jobs are in the pending state. Some are marked as success. The cronjob steadily increases in the time taken to complete, at the moment it is taking around 30 seconds to complete, during which time, mysql and php are taking up heavy CPU usage.

A MYSQL query log shows Magento churning through all the pending requests, but they are never marked as success. Hence the ever increasing list of jobs to run.

The toolbar remains on the page

https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/7768

n Magento\Catalog\Model\ResourceModel\Product\Collection, addAttributeToSort() has the following lines:

            $this->getSelect()->order("is_saleable " . $dir);
            return $this;
        }
But the generated SQL query selects stock_status_index.stock_status as 'is_salable', not 'is_saleable'. So adding 'is_saleable' causes an SQL exception and since 'is_salable' is not a product attribute, it silently fails to be added to the SQL statement.

The product stock_status is included in the query sort clause.

Saving a configurable product, its child products (super links) are deleted and then re-inserted in catalog_product_super_link, causing the AUTO_INCREMENT identifier (link_id) to grow every time.

Actual result
Magneto sends correct email content, but FROM EMAIL and FROM NAME are both from the primary store ABC.com instead of the store the customer used, XYZ.com.

#### JavaScript framework

<!--- MAGETWO-83401 -->* Fix depends field not working for radio elements #11539

Currently the `<depends>` field only works when used on elements of `select` type, this PR aims to replicate the same functionality for fields with `radios` type.

<depends> field doesn't work in system.xml for "radios" fields

In system.xml file a field can depend on another field value; it will be shown or not depending from previous field choice.
It works fine if the field depends on a "select" field but if you try to use a "radios" field dependency the mechanism doesn't work and the field will always be shown.

Expected result
discount_calculation value = 'automatic' => discount_category is shown
discount_calculation value = 'manual' => discount_category is not shown
Actual result
discount_category is always shown so is not working
If I declare discount_calculation field as "select" type, all works fine

<!--- MAGETWO-86880 -->* WEBAPI: PHP session is always started #1247
Although REST API should be stateless for anonymous calls, PHP session is always created. This is caused by the fact that session_start() is called implicitly from '\Magento\Framework\Session\SessionManager' constructor.

There are 2 issues with this: Spammed PHP session which will never be used, if remote address validation is enabled for sessions, clients with dynamic IP address will get 302 redirect instead of REST API result, and this is undesirable.

The fix was to test the $image->getLabel() response and if it was empty to use the product's name instead.

Set the image as Hide for product page in that store view.
Got to System -> Export.
Select Products and then Continue.
Expected result
The CSV files should have 2 lines. The default values at the first row of values.
The second lines should contain values on sku, store_view_code and hide_from_product_page columns
Actual result
I've created my simple product with an image. Same values for both store views.

<!--- MAGETWO-84448 -->* Added an abbility to import/export store view specific product custom options and bundle product options. 
- To import store specific product custom option title and value each product with custom options should have an additional string with store code specified in store_view_code row and required custom option data (store specific "name", "type" and "option_title" it should be changed) in custom_options row.
- To import store specific bundle product option title this option name should be added to the "bundle_values" row (together with data for main store). Bundle option name value should have store code specified in the name key - if store code is "second_store", name key for this option is "name_second_store". 
The full "bundle_value" row will looks like: "name=BundleOption1,name_second_store=BundleOption1 Second Store,type=select,required=1..." 

Previously, Import/export feature does not include storeview level edits for the custom options.

If someone signed up for a Newsletter subscription as a guest, have confirmed that subscription, and then create an account with the same emailâthen the Magento application could update the Newsletter Subscribers with the customer data and leave the status as Subscribed, thus no Need to Confirm email is sent since they've already confirmed they wanted to receive the newsletter.
The Magento application could change the guest email status to STATUS_UNCONFIRMED, update the guest email with the customer data, and send the Need to Confirm email for the new account.
Actual result
Three Need to Confirm emails are received.

This means that it is possible to have a creditmemo with an ID which still has to be refunded.
I'm creating a module that introduces a validation step for refund payments before the actual refund can take place. It uses the open state of credit memos to wait for approval and then refunds the creditmemo. Right now the credit memo is not refundable once it has an ID.

If before steps 3 and 4 from "Steps to reproduce" go to Admin > Sales > Create New Order and when creating it select some different Store View (e.g.: Italian, with id = 10) then actual result after "Steps to reproduce" will show allowed countries for that selected Store View (with id = 10, if continue on example).

<!--- MAGETWO-80233 -->* Added support to create later authorizations with PayPal "Order" action
Previously, Paypal cannot place the order when Payment Action = Order. 

ACTUAL RESULTS:
"We cant place order" error shows
../var/log/support_report.log contains:

DETAILS:

When PayPal is set to Authorize mode, the order can be placed successfully.
However, when mode is changed to Order, upon reaching Review page and clicking Place Order, the page refreshes and an error is displayed: "We can't place the order."
I was able to replicate it in clean magento. If Payment action is set to Authorize, it goes through. If Payment Action is set to Order, it gives the error. I didnt check the other payment action Sale. But it is only in Order where you have to enter Merchant ID. Not sure if that's connected to the issue or not.
ADDITIONAL NOTES FROM MERCHANT:

They have an external ERP system that needs to perform the authorization
Magento needs to omit the auth when placing an order on the site so it can be done later by the ERP (ERP APIs don't allow to insert a record based on previously created auth)

### Payment methods
<!--- MAGETWO-86940 -->* Dedicated debug logging files for Payment and Shipping activity
As a Magento developer, I want to have dedicated log files for payment and shipping activity so that it's easy for me to find information relevant to one particular area of functionality and it can be separated from other debugging log noise.

Today all general debug information, if logging is turned on, gets compiled into one file, which makes it hard to find what developers are looking for due to all the noise (example: lots of entries about cache invalidation). There is not enough control to decouple logging info based on functional area.

The proposal is to create dedicated payment and shipping debug log files to store information particular to those functional areas.

<!--- MAGETWO-81395 -->* 3rd party developers have the possibility to customize payment errors messages for payment integrations based on Magento Payment Provider Gateway, more documentation will be available after merge 

This task is extremely valuable to implement in Magento. First, this would eliminate a large volume of support issues that come in around this functionality (the above GH issue list may not even include all issues). In addition, it is a very commonly requested feature from the community - partners, SIs, extension developers. As an example the group developing the latest version of the Braintree payments extension requested this capability just a few weeks ago. Finally, this enables building much better front-end experiences for the Shoppers and would most certainly increase Magento store conversions. 
The team already has a working prototype completed, so productionalizing this would not be a large effort. Considering very high value and relatively low effort to implement, I consider this a "low hanging fruit" effort worth pulling into the closest patch release.

My fix adds key value as null and it fixes the notice.

<!--- MAGETWO-84639 -->* Correctly set payment information when using paypal 

PR #12401

https://github.com/therool
RiÄards ZÄlÄ«tis

Correctly set payment method information when using PayPal Express so the checkout agreements data is correctly added to the request and validated correctly. 
Edited the `Magento_Paypal
/js/action/set-payment-method` to use the `Magento_Checkout/js/action/set-payment-information` so the additional payment/checkout data is correctly added.
Magento 2.2 Paypal Can't Accept Checkout Agreements Before Routing to PayPal 

This could potentially be a module conflict, but after stepping through and inspecting the checkout code I can't find any obvious third-party interference.

When going through standard checkout and selecting PayPal Express at the payment step, there is an agreements checkbox present. However, checking this box does nothing as the agreements data is not parsed and passed to the set-payment-information API. This triggers the CheckoutAgreements validation plugin which fails to validate with no agreements data.

When I override the PayPal JS to add the agreements data to the paymentData before sending to the API, it passes validation but then fails because PayPal doesn't allow setting extension data.
