Previously, you were not warned about invalid SKU values, and when you clicked **Save**, all the product information you entered was lost. *Fix submitted by [Zamaroka](https://github.com/zamoroka) in pull request 12737*. [GitHub-11953](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11953)

<!--- MAGETWO-86918 -->* Product records inside the `catalog_product_super_link` table are no longer updated needlessly when you save a configurable product. Previously, saving configurable product erased and then reinserted records in the `catalog_product_super_link` table even when child products were not changed. This practice quickly resulted in unnecessarily large `catalog_product_super_link` table, especially in multi-website installations.

[GitHub-7241](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/7241)

[GitHub-12715](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12715)

<!--- MAGETWO-85672 -->* The `window.checkout.customerLoginUrl` now contains a URL that includes the referer in base64 encoding (for example, https://myshop.com/customer/account/login/referer/aHR0cHM6Ly9teXNob3AuY29tL2NoZWNrb3V0). Previously, the login URL did not include a referer (for example, https://myshop.com/customer/account/login). *Fix submitted by [Tommy Quissens](https://github.com/quisse) in pull request 12630*.m[GitHub-12627](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12627)

<!--- MAGETWO-85833 -->* `Magento\Eav\Model\Config::getAttribute` now stops the Profiler before it returns Profiler run time.

<!--- MAGETWO-87588 -->*  The `beforeSave` method encodes an attribute value only when it has not yet been encoded. Previously,t the JSON-encoded attribute value was loaded  correctly, but when you saved a product multiple times,  the attribute value was also be encoded multiple times. Consequently, Magento did save the product, and  displayed this error, **Unable to unserialize value**. *Fix submitted by [Tibor Kotosz](https://github.com/tkotosz) in pull request 13551*.

<!--- MAGETWO-87354 -->* The deprecated `each()` function has been removed from the code. *Fix submitted by [Ihor Sviziev](https://github.com/ihor-sviziev) in pull request*.

<!--- MAGETWO-86154 -->* `X-Magento-Vary` and `PHPSESSID` now have the same expiration time. Previously, the  `X-Magento-Vary` cookie had an expiration of `session`, which meant it was not considered expired until the browser was closed.

<!--- MAGETWO-86748 -->* remove TestObserver class 
*Fix submitted by [Alexander Shkurko](https://github.com/Coderimus) in pull request 13174*.


The `Magento\ProductAlert\Controller\Add\TestObserver`, as I can see, was used for testing propose. It can run methods for sending product alert (price and stock) emails and, also, error emails for admin: `Magento\ProductAlert\Model\Observer::process()`. The main reason why I created this PR and remove reported class is that it can be run by any logged in customer while `process()` method should be run only by an event or by cron.

<!--- MAGETWO-86840 -->* GitHub 12322: Bug with CDATA in XML layout update 
*Fix submitted by [Serhii](https://github.com/serhii-balko) in pull request 1163*.


When you enter the first time a xml with CDATA it works as expected. After saving the CDATA tag is gone. 

The CDATA tag is added in the database field, so it gets stripped when they view is outputting the code from the database.
A CDATA section cannot contain the string "]]>" and therefore it is not possible for a CDATA section to contain nested CDATA sections. The preferred approach to using CDATA sections for encoding text that contains the triad "]]>" is to use multiple CDATA sections by splitting each occurrence of the triad just before the ">"

<!--- MAGETWO-88145 -->*  Fix bug Magento 2.2.2 password reset strength meter #
The form email input field selector at the "password-strength-indicator.js" is generic enough to match any input field "email" in the frontend at that time. This causes the password strength indicator to work in the password reset email screen in the default theme, given that this selector ends up matching the email field of the newsletter subscription form.

However, if you are using a theme in which the newsletter subscription email form is removed, it then causes this password strength validation to break. Moreover, it doesn't make much sense to compare your password with any possible email that is written in the newsletter subscription form.

<!--- MAGETWO-84764 -->* NewRelic: Disables Module Deployments, Creates new Deploy Marker Command 
*Fix submitted by [Kristof](https://github.com/fooman) in pull request 12477*. 

The "report module enable/disable changes as deployment markers" functionality in the Magento_NewRelicReporting module is broken. Irrespective of actual module enabling/disabling, if New Relic's cron is enabled Magento will send a New Relic Deployment markers for every enabled module once per cron period. This is for an hourly cron and an average of 100 modules in a module system, this is approximatly 2,400 event per individual Magento cron server, per day. This is flooding New Relic's systems with -- let's call it a lot -- of traffic. New Relic is taking steps to drop these deployment requests, but they're still a burden on the system. Also, this creates an almost unusable deployment feature in the New Relic UI. Finally, this creates slow running cron and needless network traffic for individual Magento systems.

<!--- MAGETWO-83783 -->* The `Magento\Sales\Service\V1\OrderCreateTest` test now has the correct shipping method fixture.

Previously, you could check this box, but Magento did not parse  the agreements data  or pass it  to the set-payment-information API.

<!--- MAGETWO-86426 -->* Magento no longer archives active orders that are placed using PayPal Express Checkout. Previously, if you placed an order using PayPal Express Checkout, Magento would place the order as expected but also add it to the list of archived orders.

Fatal error: Call getTranslateInline of null when generating some sitemap with errors 
This PR changes the logic for handling errors in the sitemap generation cron. If an exception is thrown when trying to generate any of the sitemaps, the processes is not stopped anymore, but instead the errors are sent by email based on the XML Sitemap configuration. The old `_translateModel` property is not used anymore, and the inline translation is correctly suspended using the `inlineTranslation` property instead.

expected result: An email is delivered to the configured email address and the cron task should be successful.

actual result: Cron task is successful. There are no new emails in Inbox or Spam

<!--- MAGETWO-85708 -->* You can now successfully close full-screem zoomed product images displayed on an iPhone 4s, 5s, 6, or 6s with the Safari browser. Previously, if you chose full screen zoom for any product image, you could not close the full screen zoom.

<!--- MAGETWO-85784-->* You can now configure a form field with validation range-words.
