Previously, you were not warned about invalid SKU values, and when you clicked **Save**, all the product information you entered was lost. *Fix submitted by [Zamaroka](https://github.com/zamoroka) in pull request 12737*. [GitHub-11953](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11953)

<!--- MAGETWO-86918 -->* Product records inside the `catalog_product_super_link` table are no longer updated needlessly when you save a configurable product. Previously, saving configurable product erased and then reinserted records in the `catalog_product_super_link` table even when child products were not changed. This practice quickly resulted in unnecessarily large `catalog_product_super_link` table, especially in multi-website installations.

<!--- MAGETWO-83026 -->* The `isConfirmationRequired` method in the `AccountManagement` class is now public, which makes it available for plugins. (For example, you can now develop custom business logic to decide if confirmation is required (yes/no) for certain customers.) *Fix submitted by [Derrick Heesbeen](https://github.com/dheesbeen) in pull request 11878*. 

<!--- MAGETWO-82635 -->* When configuring a customer account, you can now leave the prefix or suffix fields as optional.

[GitHub-7241](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/7241)

[GitHub-12715](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12715)

<!--- MAGETWO-85672 -->* The `window.checkout.customerLoginUrl` now contains a URL that includes the referer in base64 encoding (for example, https://myshop.com/customer/account/login/referer/aHR0cHM6Ly9teXNob3AuY29tL2NoZWNrb3V0). Previously, the login URL did not include a referer (for example, https://myshop.com/customer/account/login). *Fix submitted by [Tommy Quissens](https://github.com/quisse) in pull request 12630*.m[GitHub-12627](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12627)

[GitHub-6965](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/6965)

<!--- MAGETWO-85302 -->* Magento now uses the correct  `entity_model` in `table eav_entity_type` for invoices (`Magento\Sales\Model\ResourceModel\Order\Invoice`). Previously, in `table eav_entity_type` for `entity_type_code = "invoice"` the `entity_model` was `Magento\Sales\Model\ResourceModel\Order`. *Fix submitted by [Nickolas Malyovanets](https://github.com/nmalevanec) in pull request 980*. [GitHub-10123](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10123)

<!--- MAGETWO-72597 -->* You can now perform a mass update on products that have more than 60 attributes. 

<!--- MAGETWO-85833 -->* `Magento\Eav\Model\Config::getAttribute` now stops the Profiler before it returns Profiler run time.

<!--- MAGETWO-87588 -->*  The `beforeSave` method encodes an attribute value only when it has not yet been encoded. Previously,t the JSON-encoded attribute value was loaded  correctly, but when you saved a product multiple times,  the attribute value was also be encoded multiple times. Consequently, Magento did save the product, and  displayed this error, **Unable to unserialize value**. *Fix submitted by [Tibor Kotosz](https://github.com/tkotosz) in pull request 13551*.

<!--- MAGETWO-87354 -->* The deprecated `each()` function has been removed from the code. *Fix submitted by [Ihor Sviziev](https://github.com/ihor-sviziev) in pull request*.

[GitHub-11740](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11740)

<!--- MAGETWO-86881 -->* Magento no longer sends misleading feedback when sending tracking information email.

[GitHub-5697](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/5697)

[GitHub-4292](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/4292)

<!--- MAGETWO-86154 -->* `X-Magento-Vary` and `PHPSESSID` now have the same expiration time. Previously, the  `X-Magento-Vary` cookie had an expiration of `session`, which meant it was not considered expired until the browser was closed.

<!--- MAGETWO-85992 -->* `\Magento\Config\Model\Config\Structure\Reader::processingDocument`  now throws a more helpful validation exception. *Fix submitted by [Patrick McLain](https://github.com/pmclain) in pull request 12859*.

### General

<!--- MAGETWO-82866 -->* Magento now displays information messages about both successful and failed actions when a company administrator adds or deletes entries in the  Company Users section. Previously, Magento displayed this error message, **Something went wrong**  in the response body, and did not display a message.

<!--- MAGETWO-81128 -->* Credit card form is now available when you create an order from the Admin, even when only one payment method is enabled. Previously, when only one payment method was enabled, the Admin did not render this form.

<!--- MAGETWO-73473 -->* You can now implement translations from themes (in contrast to translations from modules).

<!--- MAGETWO-72865 -->* Full Page Cache is no longer invalidated after you save a predictor category. Previously, all product-related cache data was invalidated, when only a narrow subset of cache tags associated with the `product_id` should have been.

<!--- MAGETWO-70336 -->* You can now delete rows from the `dynamicRows` component. Previously, Magento threw a JavaScript console output error when you tried to delete a row using the **Bin** icon while editing a product description. [GitHub-8830](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8830)

<!--- MAGETWO-84474 -->* Magento now saves new orders  to the Order display as expected when created by a guest account.

[GitHub-10128](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10128)

<!--- MAGETWO-84284 -->* CAPTCHA labels now reflect both the symbols and jetters associated with the CAPTCHA image. Previously, the text labels referred to the CAPTCHA image referred to letters only, despite there being numbers in the CAPTCHA images, too. This ambiguity had the potential to mislead users about the text to enter. *Fix submitted by [RhodriOwainDavies](https://github.com/RhodriOwainDavies) in pull request 12387*. 

<!--- MAGETWO-84006 -->* The `robots.txt` response header content type is now plain text. *Fix submitted by [Milan Osztromok](https://github.com/tufahu) in pull request 12310*. 

<!--- MAGETWO-82666 -->* A database backup created by `setup:backup --db` and restored with `setup:rollback -d` now includes triggers as expected.

[GitHub-9036](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9036)

<!--- MAGETWO-84004 -->* If you extend a dynamic row element in a ui_component and add a sort order attribute with an amount that falls between the other attributes' amounts, Magento will correctly sort the fields, but the label you added is placed in last position. *Fix submitted by [Harald Deiser](https://github.com/deiserh) in pull request 12310*. 

<!--- MAGETWO-87242 -->*  When you select a new main menu option, the previously selected  menu item now loses the `ui-state-active` class as expected. *Fix submitted by [Arnoud Beekman](https://github.com/arnoudhgz) in pull request 13341*.

<!--- MAGETWO-85311 -->* Issues with displaying full-screen images and video on the configurable product page have been resolved.

[GitHub-12268](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12268)

<!--- MAGETWO-84764 -->* We've fixed issues with the "report module enable/disable changes as deployment markers" functionality in the Magento_NewRelicReporting module. Previously, if New Relic's cron was enabled,  Magento  sent a New Relic deployment marker for every enabled module once per cron period. This resulted in an excessive number of events. *Fix submitted by [Kristof](https://github.com/fooman) in pull request 12477*. 


### Gift card

<!--- MAGETWO-88105 -->* Magento now includes a gift card recipient's email address in the gift card account history. Previously, Magento did not include the gift card recipient's name and email address in the gift card account history, even though Magento successfully sent the email. 



### Import/export

<!--- MAGETWO-81368 -->* You can now successfully import product images and image labels from CSV files. Previously after import, the  alt text field on the Admin was empty, even though the label was imported and is visible on the product list page as alt attribute, and the Product Detail page missed the alt attribute on image fields.*Fix submitted by [Ben Robie](https://github.com/brobie) in pull request 11323*.[GitHub-9931](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9931)

<!--- MAGETWO-86657 -->* When you import information about existing customers, Magento no changes only the specific rows for this customer.

<!--- MAGETWO-88044 -->* Magento now provides a test for adding values in the system variable collection unit test. 
*Fix submitted by [Nickolas Malyovanets](https://github.com/nmalevanec) in pull request 13742*.

<!--- MAGETWO-74042 -->* You can now successfully import import configurable products with specified configurable links when the `store_view_code` setting isn't set.

### Indexing

### Infrastructure

<!--- MAGETWO-86542 -->* Zoom now works as expected when using dropdown menus. Previously, zoom worked fine, but when you hovered over the category dropdown menu to the overlap area of product image and dropdown menu, the zoom was abnormally active,  even the mouse was still on the dropdown menu.
*Fix submitted by [Mayank Zalavadia](https://github.com/mayankzalavadia) in pull request 13084*. [GitHub-5129](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/5129)

<!--- MAGETWO-86505 -->* RequireJS loading issues that occur when ad blockers are active have been resolved. Previously, `uBlock` (or any ad blocker) forbade the `trackingCode.js` file from loading, which prompted RequireJS to throw  an  exception. This exception broke the JavaScript execution flow and caused unexpected issues throughout the storefront. *Fix submitted by [Yonn Trimoreau](https://github.com/Yonn) in pull request 13061*.

<!--- MAGETWO-86501 -->* `continue()` has been removed from templates. *Fix submitted by [Ihor Sviziev](https://github.com/ihor-sviziev) in pull request 13076*.

This fix is part of an ongoing effort to add pointers to valid replacements when marking methods and classes as deprecated. *Fix submitted by [Fabian Schmengler](https://github.com/schmengler) in pull request 13061*. [GitHub-10133](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11070)

<!--- MAGETWO-85332 -->* We've resolved errors that occcurred when loading theme configuration on installations running PHP 7.2. Previously, when Magento loaded theme configuration on an installation running PHP 7.2 and checked that  `$parentPathPieces` was an array before counting it, Magento threw an error when this value was `NULL`. *Fix submitted by [Alan Hardman](https://github.com/Alanaktion) in pull request 12606*.

<!--- MAGETWO-85292 -->* `\Magento\Framework\Data\Tree::getNodeById()` no longer contains an invalid type in its PHPDoc block.  *Fix submitted by [Roman K.](https://github.com/RomaKis) in pull request 964*. [GitHub-8507](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/8507)

<!--- MAGETWO-86435 -->* Magento now uses indexes to retrieve subscriber information during the creation of email to newsletter subscribers. Previously, Magento did not indexes for this task, and performance was poor. *Fix submitted by [Amit Bera](https://github.com/devamitbera) in pull request*. [GitHub-12787](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12787)

<!--- MAGETWO-86562 -->* Magento no longer sends multiple confirmation emails when a customer successfully subscribes to a newsletter. *Fix submitted by [Torben HÃ¶hn](https://github.com/torhoehn) in pull request 13044*. [GitHub-12876](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12876)

### Orders

<!--- MAGETWO-75840 -->* Magento now shows all products as expected in the Recently Ordered list when you place an order that contains products from multiple stores. Previously, in installations with two storefronts, if you added products from both stores to the same shopping cart, and placed a single order, the recently ordered product list would not show all ordered products. 

<!--- MAGETWO-82577 -->*  The `getDefaultStoreLocale()` method has been added to allow for the fetching of scoped values. Use this method in `getCreatedAtFormatted()` to ensure that Magento translates the  `created_at` order date in emails for the locale being used in that store view. *Fix submitted by [Jeroen](https://github.com/JeroenVanLeusden) in pull request 11067*.

<!--- MAGETWO-83410 -->*  You can now successfully open the Order edit page for orders that contain an address with extension attributes. Previously, when you tried to open this page, the page load failed with this error, `Recoverable Error: Object of class Magento\Sales\Api\Data\OrderAddressExtension could not be converted to string in .../module-sales/Model/AdminOrder/Create.php on line 503`. 

<!--- MAGETWO-83552 -->* Magento now saves an invoice ID on the credit memo when you create a credit memo from the invoice in the Admin. Previously, 
the invoice ID was not included.  *Fix submitted by [Anton Evers](https://github.com/ajpevers) in pull request 11067*. [GitHub-11669](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11669)

<!--- MAGETWO-83740 -->* Credit memos can have the state open (`\Magento\Sales\Model\Order\Creditmemo::STATE_OPEN`). As a result, you can create a creditmemo with an ID that still has to be refunded, and existing credit memos should be refundable if their state is open. *Fix submitted by [Anton Evers](https://github.com/ajpevers) in pull request 11550*.

<!--- MAGETWO-83783 -->* The `Magento\Sales\Service\V1\OrderCreateTest` test now has the correct shipping method fixture. Previously, this test contained an incorrect shipping method fixture, which produced an error whenever an order's shipping method was treated an object. *Fix submitted by [andrew-garside-temando](https://github.com/andrew-garside-temando) in pull request 12227*.
 
<!--- MAGETWO-84219 -->* When you use the REST API to create a credit memo, Magento now sends  credit memo update emails as expected. Previously, under these circumstances, Magento did not send this email, and no other transaction emails were sent ot the customer.  

<!--- MAGETWO-84256 -->* The `getReservedOrderId()` method now uses the current store as expected instead of the default store. *Fix submitted by [Timon de Groot](https://github.com/tdgroot) in pull request 11702*. [GitHub-9055](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9055)

<!--- MAGETWO-85305 -->* When you are editing an order's shipping or billing address, Magento now displays the allowed countries from the correct store view.

[GitHub-12560](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12560)

<!--- MAGETWO-85660 -->* The `\Magento\Sales\Model\Order\Pdf\AbstractPdf::drawLineBlocks` method now works as expected. Previously, when a text block spanned more than one page, Magento threw a `Zend_Pdf_Exception` error, and displayed this error: `Font has not been set`. *Fix submitted by [Serhii](https://github.com/serhii-balko) in pull request 1016*. [GitHub-11743](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11743)

<!--- MAGETWO-86845 -->* Magento no longer exports extra records when you export invoices for multiple orders. *Fix submitted by [Sanjay Patel](https://github.com/sanjay-wagento) in pull request 13208*. [GitHub-12714](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12714)

<!--- MAGETWO-86258 -->* The cancel order and restore quote methods now accurately calculate the amount of stock to be returned to inventory when an order is canceled. Previously, when you canceled an order, some of these methods did not accurately calculate the amount of restored stock. *Fix submitted by [Danny Verkade](https://github.com/dverkade) in pull request 12668*. [GitHub-9969](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9969)

<!--- MAGETWO-87292 -->*  Join extension attributes are now added as expected to order results when the order is created using REST. *Fix submitted by [Nickolas Malyovanets](https://github.com/nmalevanec) in pull request 1168*.

<!--- MAGETWO-75497 -->* Logged-out customers can no longer see previously saved credit cards. Previously, users logged in as guest could see some payment information from an earlier, canceled order. 

<!--- MAGETWO-81322 -->* When you cancel payment of an order and return to the previous page in the workflow (the checkout page), Magento now provides the shipping address and other information as expected. Previously, Magento did not load the shipping address after you canceled payment of an order and returned to the checkout page. [GitHub-11247](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11247)

<!--- MAGETWO-81395 -->* Third-party developers can now customize payment errors messages for payment integrations based on Magento Payment Provider Gateway. 

<!--- MAGETWO-82910 -->* PayPal Express Checkout now appears as a payment option on the Checkout page when the PayPal buttons are available on the shopping cart page.

<!--- MAGETWO-83959-->* You can now view order details for an order created with a custom offline payment method. Previously, Magento displayed  PHP warning (undefined index) instead of the order details. *Fix submitted by [Alex](https://github.com/madonzy) in pull request 12296*. [GitHub-3596](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/3596)

<!--- MAGETWO-86112 -->*  Magento no longer disables the BrainTree **Place Order** button after a failed payment validation. *Fix submitted by [Ievgen Sentiabov](https://github.com/joni-jones) in pull request 12902*.

<!--- MAGETWO-86308 -->* If you've chosen a custom payment method that is offline when you create an order, Magento now displays that payment method's name as expected when you view order details in **Payment & Shipping**. *Fix submitted by [zamoroka](https://github.com/zamoroka) in pull request 12731*. [GitHub-12209](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12209)

<!--- MAGETWO-86351 -->* Paypal now works as expected with virtual products such as gift cards. Previously, when you tried to place an order for a virtual product using PayPal, Magento did not display the PayPal popup when you clicked **Continue PayPal** during checkout.

<!--- MAGETWO-84639 -->* Magento now correctly adds checkout agreements data to  requests and validates payment information when you place an order using PayPal Express. Previously, you could check this box, but Magento did not parse  the agreements data  or pass it  to the set-payment-information API. This failure in turn triggered the CheckoutAgreements validation plugin,  which failed to validate with no agreements data. *Fix submitted by [RiÄards ZÄlÄ«tis](https://github.com/therool) in pull request 12401*. 

<!--- MAGETWO-86426 -->* Magento no longer archives active orders that are placed using PayPal Express Checkout. Previously, if you placed an order using PayPal Express Checkout, Magento would place the order as expected but also add it to the list of archived orders. 

<!--- MAGETWO-84647 -->* Magento now correctly displays transparent `.png` watermarks on JPEG images. Previously, Magento did not correctly display a transparent watermark as expected on an image, but instead displayed a white outline of the box where the watermark should be. *Fix submitted by [Elze Kool](https://github.com/elzekool) in pull request 11060*. [GitHub-10661](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10661)

<!--- MAGETWO-86742 -->* As part of the micro-optimization of the `Magento\EAV` module, we've replaced `is_null` with strict comparison only for models and block in this module. *Fix submitted by [Alexander Shkurko](https://github.com/Coderimus) in pull request 13169*.


### Quote
<!--- MAGETWO-86439 -->* If you change the currency type of your order-in-progress while viewing the shopping cart, Magento displays a message that shows the minimum order necessary in the new currency. Previously, this minimum was calculated incorrectly. *Fix submitted by [Neeta Kangiya](https://github.com/neeta-wagento) in pull request 13039*.

<!--- MAGETWO-86434 -->* Magento no longers truncates very long telephone numbers in the order page.

<!--- MAGETWO-85708 -->* You can now successfully close full-screem zoomed product images displayed on an iPhone 4s, 5s, 6, or 6s with the Safari browser. Previously, if you chose full screen zoom for any product image, you could not close the full screen zoom.

[GitHub-12081](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12081)


### User interface

<!--- MAGETWO-85784-->* You can now configure a form field with validation range-words.
