## Fixes and enhancements


### Installation, setup, and deployment
<!--- MAGETWO-86496 -->* The magento backup command fails under magento 2.2.1. There was no such issue under magento 2.1.8. They are no errors in the database log. Previously, an issue with the database backup process caused the backup process to fail.

<!--- MAGETWO-86045 -->* Some of the links insode theMagento installer to magento installation documentation devdocs are outdated. This PR fixes this within progress.phtml. PR 12857 @jonashrem Jonas HÃ¼nig https://github.com/jonashrem

<!--- MAGETWO-84506 -->* Add command `app:config:status` to check whether config propagation is up to date. This command can be used to decide whether `app:config:import` execution is needed during deployments. On version 2.2 a new command `setup:db:status` was added to decide whether executing `setup:upgrade` is required. The purpose of this command was to add the possibility of deploying without executing `setup:upgrade` if module versions are up to date.
With the same objective, a command to check the config status is needed to decide whether `app:config:import` is needed.

*Issue*
If `setup:upgrade` is not executed, we need to always execute `app:config:import` because there is no way to know, if config files are up to date or not. This will mean, we still need to set the maintenance and we cannot simply switch the code to the new version.

<!--- MAGETWO-87900 -->*  Add option "lock-config" for shell command "config:set"

In most cases, configuration settings should be shared among all development, staging and live instances of a shop. To achieve this, you can use the same mechanism as with the --lock switch described in http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-config-mgmt-set.html.

The only difference is that the configuration values will be stored in app/etc/config.php instead of app/etc/env.php. This file should usually be included in the VCS and thus shared between instances.

The size of cron_schedule table is constantly increasing every minute. The majority of the jobs are in the pending state. Some are marked as success. The cronjob steadily increases in the time taken to complete, at the moment it is taking around 30 seconds to complete, during which time, mysql and php are taking up heavy CPU usage.

A MYSQL query log shows Magento churning through all the pending requests, but they are never marked as success. Hence the ever increasing list of jobs to run.

Saving a configurable product, its child products (super links) are deleted and then re-inserted in catalog_product_super_link, causing the AUTO_INCREMENT identifier (link_id) to grow every time. Even if no changes were made before saving. This database column is limited to int(11), so it could be filled up quickly on big sized catalogues in multi-website installations.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
Product records inside catalog_product_super_link table should not be updated.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
Product records inside catalog_product_super_link table have now a new, bigger link_id value.

Even though no conversion takes place during the formatting of the given amount, the method only works if a conversion rate from the base currency to the specified currency is configured.

There is no technical need for this limitation.
Expected result
The specified amount should be formatted in the specified currency.

Actual result
The specified amount is surprisingly rendered in the base currency.

### EAV attributes

<!--- MAGETWO-86240 -->* Naming collision in Javascript ui registry (backend) 


https://github.com/VladimirZaets

Volodymyr Zaets

The JS is broken in next case: when new configurable attribute is created with the code name that is equal to "index" property of any uiComponent on the page.
https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12555

Add a configurable attribute with attribute code set as "content", or any other name which exists as identifier on the product edit page (for example, "gallery", "review" ,"related").

Add it to the default attribute set

Edit a product.

Expected result
You can properly edit/save the product and add configurations setting that attribute.
Actual result
All kinds of Javascript issues arise when trying to save the product
This is because somehow most HTML elements end up in a registry and are then retrieved on various places.

Expected result

Actual result

Multiselect Attribute is not saved for a product in the admin panel when it has a related product using another attribute set

<!--- MAGETWO-85579 -->* Attribute repository resets sourceModel for new attributes. 

PR #1012
https://github.com/nmalevanec

Malyovanets Nickolas

https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/10814

When creating a new product attribute through code, product attribute repository save method resets source model to null or something else. Therefore a new attribute is created with an empty option (in case of select or multiselect input type). This happens only for new attributes not when updating exiting attributes.

Expected Result
It is expected that when some data is set on a model, repository should not change or reset it.
