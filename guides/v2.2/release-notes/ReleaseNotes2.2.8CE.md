---

*Patch code and release notes were published on .*


We are pleased to present Magento Open Source 2.2.8. This release includes over 30 critical enhancements to product security, over 150 core code fixes and enhancements, and over 350 community-submitted pull requests. 

Although this release includes these security enhancements, no confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions, so we recommend that you upgrade your Magento software to the latest version as soon as possible.

See [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2.3.1-2.2.8-and-2.1.17-security-update) for a comprehensive discussion of these issues. All exploitable security issues fixed in this release (2.2.8) have been ported to 2.3.1, 2.1.17, 1.14.4.1, and 1.9.4.1, as appropriate.
