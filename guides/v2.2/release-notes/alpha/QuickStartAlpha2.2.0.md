* Submit comments on Magento 2.2.0 Alpha

* Readiness status of individual code components. Magento 2.2.0 Alpha code is a work in progress. Parts of the code base are more mature than others. You can see an overview of component status here. Note that we will update this information each Friday of the Alpha evaluation period.

## Welcome to Magento Alpha 2.2.0 

Magento 2.2.0 Alpha release code is not production quality and will include bugs and incomplete features. It does provide a snapshot of the current 2.2.0 codebase and consequently an early peak into the new features that 2.2.0 will provide in more robust form. 



### Goals of this release

Participation in this Alpha evaluation has benefits for both community members and Magento. 


#### Magento goals

Our primary goal for this release is to invite and receive community and partner feedback that will help us refine our 2.2.0 product code before GA. Specifically, we hope that participants in this Alpha release evaluation can report on:

* **Functionality**. Keep in mind that this Alpha release does not contains all the functionality that the 2.2.0 GA release will include.   

* **Usability**. How do the features we've implemented for Alpha work in context of your typical workflows?

* **Code quality issues**. Are there particularly challenging processes or tasks that need improvement?

* **Feature gaps and enhancements**. Can you identify any steps within existing features that are missing, or enhancements that would improve features?



#### Participant goals

As community members and Partners, you have much to gain from participating in this release, too. Early access to this code provides you with the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the code and start training technical team members. Likewise, you can start planning  extension and custom code updates. 



### Usage guidelines

Keep in mind the following features of this Alpha code release during your evaluation: 

* Alpha code is not production quality and will contain bugs. Report these bugs as GitHub issues, please!

* Alpha code is for testing and training only. Do not use Alpha Software for production deployments. Any sites developed with Alpha software will require significant reworking to accomodate future code updates. 

* No technical support is available for problems you encounter during Alpha evaluation.

* You cannot share Alpha code with anyone external to your organization.



### Participants

How you participate in this evaluation depends upon which code base you'll be downloading and evaluating: CE, EE, and/or B2B.



#### CE Evaluation participants

We invite any Magento community member to participate in the Magento 2.2.0 CE Alpha evaluation. 



#### EE and B2B Evaluation participants

The Magento 2.2.0 EE Alpha evaluation is open to all Solution Partners. To participate, you must:

* Sign the Alpha Software agreement 

* Provide GitHub account information. You can either provide either: 

	* your Solution Partner GitHub account, clearly labeled with the name of the Partner, the Partner’s logo, and a link to the Partner’s website.

	or

	* an Individual Account for a Solution Partner Employee. Company name field must contain the Partner’s name or @partnername. Alternatively, the user’s profile must show that the developer is a member of the Solution Partner’s GitHub Organization.
