<h2 id="fedg-overview-introduction">Introduction</h2>

This guide discusses how to change the look and feel of your Magento storefront (sometimes referred to as the *front end* or *frontend*).  

There are four levels of customization you can apply to your site, where the levels require different development skills:

*	You can make relatively simple changes to your site using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to change colors and the look-and-feel of various interface components, replacing images, and other relatively cosmetic changes.  No structural changes are made to pages&mdash;you accept the structure of the site provided by default by modules you load on to your site.  

	This can be a good starting point for a site as it is requires the least effort and knowledge.
*	A small step beyond changing CSS and images on your site is to make changes to the HTML generated by existing modules.  This requires rudimentary PHP skills to adjust PHTML template files.  Although PHP coding is involved, this is typically copying and pasting small fragments of PHP code from existing template files into a new template file with differently structured HTML.  

	This can be useful if the existing HTML generated does not have sufficient CSS class names or HTML elements to achieve the presentation change you would like to achieve.
*	The next level of sophistication is to make structural changes to your site by moving functionality between places on a page or to completely different pages.  This is achieved using the Magento layout engine.  No PHP coding is required to make layout changes, but the layout engine is moderately sophisticated.
*	Finally, you can develop new modules to add new custom functionality to your site or to extend functionality provided by existing Magento or third party modules.  This third level of customization is not addressed in this guide.  
	Refer to the Developers' Guide for details on how to develop new modules.  This requires PHP programming knowledge in addition to knowledge of all of the preceding areas.
