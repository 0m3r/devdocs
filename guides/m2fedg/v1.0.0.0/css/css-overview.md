You can customize Magento themes by using CSS to add your own images and fonts. 

We recommend against using CSS visibility properties to hide Magento blocks and content. If you want to add or remove blocks in Magento, use the XML file instead.

You can customize Magento themes in the following ways:

*	Using the built-in Leaner CSS (LESS) preprocessor and the Magento UI library. This is the most effective way to customize your theme, by simply changing the value of required variables from the predefined Blank theme as described here. Doing this causes a new set of CSS parameters set to be compiled from LESS.
*	Building your own LESS theme using the built-in LESS preprocessor. Optionally, you can use Magento UI library alongside your theme.
*	Creating your own CSS.
*	Including and using another preprocessor such as SASS.
