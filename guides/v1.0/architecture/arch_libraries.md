<h2 id="m2arch-libraries-overview"> Overview</h2>
Libraries consist of reusable logic that is often useful across multiple applications, including application frameworks. They don't provide any independent business features, but act as building blocks for modules and themes.

Libraries are placed in the /lib folder and are also organized by vendor to be PSR-0 compliant.
