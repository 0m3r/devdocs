<h2 id="m2arch-themes-overview"> Overview</h2>
Themes allow you to customize the look-and-feel of the Magento application. Themes generally provide no new business features of their own, other than branding and user experience. They relate to each other through inheritance, allowing you to customize an existing theme by setting it as the parent and then defining any desired customizations in the new theme.

Themes are located in the /app/themes folder of a Magento installation, and each theme contains a theme.xml file, which hold the name and version of that theme, as well as the name of the parent theme, if any. Themes are also divided by area, allowing you define themes that customize either the storefront or admin sections of the Magento application independently.
