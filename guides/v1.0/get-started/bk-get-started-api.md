The Magento web API framework makes it easy to call Magento services through REST or SOAP.

You use a client to access these services. These clients include:

* Third-party applications. For example, a mobile application.
* External batch jobs that run without user intervention.
* JavaScript widgets in the Magento storefront or Admin interface. The widget makes AJAX calls to access services.
