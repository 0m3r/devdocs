<p>The Magento web API framework makes it easy to call Magento services through REST or  SOAP.</p>
<p>You use a client to access these services. These clients include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Third-party applications. For example, a mobile application.</li>
<li>External batch jobs that run without user intervention.</li>
<li>JavaScript widgets in the Magento storefront or Admin interface. The widget makes AJAX calls to access services.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide introduces web API, REST, and cURL command concepts. It shows you how to authenticate and construct and run REST web API calls. You run REST web API calls through <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}get-started/gs-curl.html">cURL commands</a> or a REST client.</p>
