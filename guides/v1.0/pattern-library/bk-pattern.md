<h2>Welcome to the Magento Design Pattern Library</h2>

###What is a design pattern?

A design pattern is an agreed-upon guide for creating UI features, such as scroll bars, buttons, forms, and image galleries, using basic design elements. Patterns also outline best practices for design of interactive elements such as dropdown menus and sorting tools. 

###Why use design patterns?

Design patterns are essential to building coherent, attractive and easy-to-use websites and applications.

Design patterns improve an organizationâ€™s efficiency, allowing faster time-to-market, more reuse and less rework.

Most important, a design pattern provides a common language and concrete reference for collaboration across all the roles in the Magento design cycle: 

* Engineers 
* Visual and Interactive Designers 
* Product Owners
* And others

###How are patterns created? 

Magento design patterns are captured in articles containing detailed specifications for visual elements on the user interface. The pattern dictates spatial relationships, placements, interactions and more, using:

* Text
* Screenshots
* Flash/Video
* Diagrams
* Flowcharts
* Use Cases
* Examples and Exceptions

###Design pattern library

The pattern library simply pulls together all UI patterns into an organized system of articles to be shared, referenced and maintained.
