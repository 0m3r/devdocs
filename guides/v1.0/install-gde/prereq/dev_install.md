## TO DO
Developer installation is the one that starts with cloning the Magento GitHub repository (i.e., the current installation). (TBD)


<h2 id="instgde-overview-composer">Composer and Magento</h2>

We now use <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">Composer</a> to install the Magento software. Composer enables us to manage the Magento system, extensions, and their dependencies.

Composer provides you with the following advantages:

*	Enables you to reuse third-party libraries without bundling them with source code
*	Component-based architecture with robust dependency management
*	Manages dependencies to reduce extension conflicts and compatibility issues
*	Versioned dependencies
*	<a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#package-versions" target="_blank">Semantic versioning</a>
*	Supports PHP Framework Interoperability standard

We'll have more information soon on how developers can use Composer to package extensions to distribute to Magento merchants and to other developers.
