## Release highlights

Welcome to Magento 2.0 Developer Beta documentation! And welcome to Magento 2.0!

In future releases, this page will provide official release notes. In this first
release of Magento 2.0, here is a summary of some important features of the
release.

-   jQuery. jQuery supports additional plugins that can be used in site
    implementations. See [Magento JQuery widgets][1].

    [1]: <http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v1.0/frontend-dev-guide/javascript/jquery-widgets-about.html>

-   HTML5. The blank and design themes available out of the box are responsive
    and based on HTML5. See [Themes][2] and [Responsive web design.][3]

    [2]: <http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v1.0/frontend-dev-guide/themes/theme-general.html>

    [3]: <http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v1.0/frontend-dev-guide/responsive-web-design/rwd_overview.html>

-   CSS3, and CSS preprocessing. The reference themes are based on CSS3. Magento
    2 uses the LESS CSS pre-processor, but you can choose to use Sass/Compass.
    See [Cascading style sheets][4], and [CSS pre-processor.][5]

    [4]: <http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v1.0/frontend-dev-guide/css-topics/css-overview.html>

    [5]: <http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v1.0/frontend-dev-guide/css-topics/css-preprocess.html>

-   RequireJS. The RequireJS library that helps load JS resources on-demand
    (asynchronously) will improve page load times, and is intended to encourage
    modular design of frontend components. See [JavaScript resources][6].

    [6]: <http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v1.0/config-guide/config/js-resources.html>

-   PHP and MySQL. Magento 2 supports PHP 5.5, with PHP 5.4 as the minimum
    requirement, and MySQL 5.6. See [System requirements][7].

    [7]: <http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v1.0/install-gde/system-requirements.html>

-   PSR Compliance. PSR compliance standardizes the use of PHP to allow
    different sets of code libraries to work together. See [PHP coding
    standard][8].

    [8]: <{{ site.gdeurl }}coding-standards/code-standard-php.html>

-   Modular architecture. Cross-module dependencies are reduced, and interfaces
    among multiple extensions are cleaner and more discrete. See [What is
    Magento?][9],  [Magento as a modular system][10], and [Service
    contracts][11].

    [9]: <http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v1.0/architecture/arch_whatis.html>

    [11]: <http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v1.0/extension-dev-guide/service-contracts/service-contracts.html>

-   Testing framework. Magento 2 includes a pre-packaged series of test scripts,
    including tests for integration, units, static environments, functional
    areas, and performance criteria. See [Magento Test Framework][12], and the
    [JavaScript unit tests][13].
