<h3 id="highlights-tech">Technology stack</h3>

-   PHP and MySQL. Magento 2 supports PHP 5.5 and 5.6, and MySQL 5.6. See [System
    requirements][1].

-   HTML5. The reference themes available out of the box are responsive and
    based on HTML5. See [Themes][2] and [Responsive web design.][3]

    [2]: <{{ site.gdeurl }}frontend-dev-guide/themes/theme-general.html>

    [3]: <{{ site.gdeurl }}frontend-dev-guide/responsive-web-design/rwd_overview.html>

-   CSS3, and CSS preprocessing. The reference themes use CSS3. Magento 2 uses
    the LESS CSS pre-processor, or you can add support for Sass and Compass. See
    [Cascading style sheets][4], and [CSS pre-processor.][5]

    [4]: <{{ site.gdeurl }}frontend-dev-guide/css-topics/css-overview.html>

    [5]: <{{ site.gdeurl }}frontend-dev-guide/css-topics/css-preprocess.html>

-   jQuery. Magento 2 uses jQuery as the primary JavaScriptÂ library. Magento
    ships with an extensible set of jQuery widgets. See [Magento JQuery
    widgets][6].

    [6]: <{{ site.gdeurl }}frontend-dev-guide/javascript/jquery-widgets-about.html>
-   RequireJS. The RequireJS library helps load JS resources on demand to
    improve page load times. It's also intended to encourage modular design of
    frontend components. See [JavaScript resources][6].

    [6]: <{{ site.gdeurl }}config-guide/config/js-resources.html>

-   PSR Compliance. PSR compliance standardizes the use of PHP to allow
    different sets of code libraries to work together. See [PHP coding
    standard][7].

    [7]: <{{ site.gdeurl }}coding-standards/code-standard-php.html>

-   Modular architecture. Define your own set of modules. Cross-module
    dependencies are reduced, and interfaces among multiple extensions are
    cleaner and more discrete. See [What is Magento?][8], [Magento as a modular
    system][9], and [Service contracts][10].

    [9]: <{{ site.gdeurl }}architecture/arch_asmodsys.html>

    [10]: <{{ site.gdeurl }}extension-dev-guide/service-contracts/service-contracts.html>

-   Testing framework. Magento 2 includes a pre-packaged series of test scripts,
    including tests for integration, units, static environments, functional
    areas, and performance criteria. See [Magento Test Framework][11], and the
    [JavaScript unit tests][12].
