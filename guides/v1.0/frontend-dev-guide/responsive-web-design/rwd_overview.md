<h2 id="fedg_rwd_overview">Overview</h2>

<!-- 
<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/12/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">Responsive web design</a> is a set of techniques that enable you to display the same content on multiple device sizes (referred to as *viewports*) without maintaining completely separate style sheets for each. -->

Responsive web design (RWD, <i>responsive design</i>) crafts web sites to provide an optimal viewing experience&mdash;easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling, across a wide range of devices (from large, high-resolution desktop computer monitors to mobile phones).

The built-in Magento Blank and Luma (which <a href="{{site.gdeurl}}frontend-dev-guide/themes/theme-inherit.html" target="_blank">inherits</a> from Blank) themes use the mobile first RWD approach. It is ensured by means of CSS, JavaScript and HTML.

<h3 id="fedg_rwd_blank_ex">Blank theme examples</h3>

The following figures show the same page built on the Blank theme on mobile and desktop devices.

Mobile:

Desktop:

We recommend to use the Blank theme, as a starting point for your customizations. That is, your custom theme should <a href="{{site.gdeurl}}frontend-dev-guide/themes/theme-inherit.html" target="_blank">inherit</a> from Blank.

The articles in this chapter describe the particular approaches used in the Blank theme, with code samples:
