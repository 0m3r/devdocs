<h2>Overview</h2>
Accordions are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space.
Accordions support arbitrary markup, but a set of data-attributes should be specified for the header, trigger and content, or all this elements must be specified with selectors as options. Also the titles and contents must be in the same order in DOM.
