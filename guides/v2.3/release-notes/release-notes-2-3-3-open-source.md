*Patch code and release notes published on *

We are pleased to present Magento Open Source 2.3.3.  This release includes over  functional fixes to the core product, over  pull requests contributed by the community, and  over 75 security enhancements. 

## Other release information

Although code for these features is bundled with quarterly releases of the Magento core code, several of these projects (for example, Page Builder, Inventory Management, and Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Studio) are also released independently. Bug fixes for these projects are documented in separate, project-specific release information which is available in the documentation for each project.
 



## Highlights

Look for the following highlights in this release:

### Substantial security enhancements

This release is focused on substantial security enhancements:

* **75 security enhancements** that help close cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution (RCE), and sensitive data disclosure vulnerabilities as well as other security issues. No confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. See [Magento Security Center](https://magento.com/security/patches/magento-2.3.3-2.2.10-security-update) for a comprehensive discussion of these issues. All known exploitable security issues fixed in this release (2.3.3) have been ported to 2.2.10, 1.14.4.3, and 1.9.4.3, as appropriate.

* **Google reCAPTCHA module for PayPal Payflow checkout**. The new PaypalRecaptcha module adds Google reCAPTCHA and CAPTCHA to the Payflow Pro checkout form.  This enhanced functionality has been added in response to malicious targeting of Magento deployments that implement Payflow Pro. Configuration information can be found in [Google reCAPTCHA](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/stores/security-google-recaptcha.html).  <!--- MC-15427-->

Starting with the release of Magento Commerce 2.3.2, Magento will assign and publish indexed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers with each security bug reported to us by external parties. This  will allows users of Magento Commerce to more easily identify unaddressed vulnerabilities in their deployment.
