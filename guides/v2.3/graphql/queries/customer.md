The `customer` query returns information about the logged-in customer.

To return or modify information about a customer, Magento recommends you use customer tokens in the header of your GraphQL calls. However, you also can use [session authentication]({{ page.baseurl }}/get-started/authentication/gs-authentication-session.html).

## Syntax

`{customer: {Customer}}`
