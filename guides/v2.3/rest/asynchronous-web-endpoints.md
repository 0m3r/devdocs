The role of asynchronous endpoint is to intercept the message to the Web API and write it to the Message Queue together with identifying information, such as UUID of the operation.

This UUID identifier is generated by Magento on a step when system accepts API request and put it to the queue.

Asynchronous Endpoints API implementing additional prefix `async` for all usual REST API requests, excluding GET Requests. Prefix added before `/V1` in usual endpoint.

Current implementation is available on all {{site.data.var.ce}} and {{site.data.var.ee}} installations.

Current Magento API routes you can found [here](https://devdocs.magento.com/swagger/index.html)
