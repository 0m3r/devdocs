Magento 2 Developer Documentation--The Beginning
=======

For the first time, Magento developer documentation is on this public github.
From humble beginnings ... currently we have a small subset of Services framework
documentation available but by the start of the Magento Imagine eConference on
May 12, 2014, we'll expand it.

What we have here now: [Magento 2 Developer's Guide](http://magento.github.io/devdocs/guides/m2devgde/V1.0.0.0/Default.htm)

Where's the rest of it? Still on the [Magento public wiki](http://wiki.magento.com/). 

Please look around, send us comments, [let us know](mailto:DL-Magento-Doc-Feedback@ebay.com) how you think we're doing.
We want to serve _you_ so let us hear from you.
