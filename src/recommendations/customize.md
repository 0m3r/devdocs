title: Overriding the Product Recommendations Template
---

Product recommendations are built on the default Magento template. If you want to customize how the recommendations are rendered on the page, you can override the template by creating a module with a specific directory structure and include files to override the look and feel of the default template. For example, you can:

-  Change the style of the template with your own HTML and CSS
-  Change the price decimal point formatting
-  Change the currency symbol for pricing
-  Change other look and feel aspects, such as dimensions, margins, colors, alignment, and so on

Refer to the [template overview]({{ base.baseurl }}/frontend-dev-guide/templates/template-walkthrough.html) for more information about how to override the default template.
