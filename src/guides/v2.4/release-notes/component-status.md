This page shows the status of each component for the latest Magento 2.4 release and is intended to show you the readiness of different components.

Each status color indicates the severity and amount of 2.4-related issues for a particular component.

-  __Red__{: .status .red} - The module has critical and blocking issues that make this module unstable.
-  __Yellow__{: .status .yellow} - The module has some issues that may cause problems, but it is still functional.
-  __Green__{: .status .green} - The module has no significant or outstanding issues.

The issues used to generate the status of these components come from verified internal and GitHub reports for Magento 2.4.
Issues that are not related to the 2.4 release are not part of this report.
