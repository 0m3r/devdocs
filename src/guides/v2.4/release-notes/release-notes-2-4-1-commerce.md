Magento Commerce 2.4.0 introduces support for

This release includes all the improvements to core quality that were included in Magento 2.4.0, over new fixes to core code, and  security enhancements. It includes the resolution of GitHub issues by our community members. These community contributions range from minor clean-up of core code to significant enhancements in Inventory Management and GraphQL.

{:.bs-callout-info}

Minor releases bring substantial code enhancements. Before upgrading to Magento 2.4.1, confirm that your environment meets the minimal [technical stack requirements](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/system-requirements-tech.html).

{:.bs-callout-info}

Quarterly releases may contain backward-incompatible changes (BIC). Magento 2.4.1 contains minor backward-incompatible changes. To review minor backward-incompatible changes, see [BIC reference]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/reference.html). (Major backward-incompatible issues are described in [BIC highlights]({{page.baseurl}}/release-notes/backward-incompatible-changes/index.html). Not all releases introduce major BICs.)

{:.bs-callout-info}

The package names of security-only releases are typically appended withÂ -p1. However, we could not avoid deviating from these naming conventions with Magento 2.3.5, which in turn has had a temporary ripple effect on the subsequent security package names. Specifically, the full-feature Magento 2.3.5 release is Magento 2.3.5-p1. The security-only release that we will release when Magento 2.4.0 GAs will be Magento 2.3.5-p2. We hope to return to the usual naming conventions in future releases.

## Security-only patch available

Merchants can now install time-sensitive security fixes without applying the hundreds of functional fixes and enhancements that a full quarterly release (for example, Magento 2.3.5-p2) provides. Patch 2.3.5.2 (Composer package 2.3.5-p2) is a security-only patch that provides fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in our previous quarterly release, Magento 2.3.5-p1. All hot fixes that were applied to the 2.3.5 release are included in this security-only patch. (A *hot fix* provides a fix to a released version of Magento that addresses a specific problem or bug.)

For general information about security-only patches, see the Magento DevBlog post [Introducing the New Security-only Patch Release](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Introducing-the-New-Security-only-Patch-Release/ba-p/141287). For instructions on downloading and applying security-only patches (including patch 2.3.5-p2), see [Install Magento using Composer]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/composer.html). Security-only patches include security bug fixes only, not the additional security enhancements that are included in the full patch.

## Other release information

Although code for these features is bundled with quarterly releases of the Magento core code, several of these projects (for example, B2B, Page Builder, Inventory Management, and Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Studio) are also released independently. Bug fixes for these projects are documented in the separate, project-specific release information that is available in the documentation for each project.

## Highlights

Look for the following highlights in this release:

### Substantial security enhancements

This release includes over 30 security fixes and platform security improvements.

#### Over  security enhancements that help close remote code execution (RCE) and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities

No confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. Most of these issues require that an attacker first obtains access to the Admin. As a result, we remind you to take all necessary steps to protect your Admin, including but not limited to these efforts: IP allowlisting, [two-factor authentication]({{page.baseurl}}/security/two-factor-authentication.html), use of a VPN, the use of a unique location rather than `/admin`, and good password hygiene. See [Security Updates Available for Magento](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb20-47.html) for a discussion of these fixed issues.

#### Additional security enhancements

{:.bs-callout-info}
Starting with the release of Magento Commerce 2.3.2, Magento will assign and publish indexed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers with each security bug reported to us by external parties. This allows users of Magento Commerce to more easily identify unaddressed vulnerabilities in their deployment. You can learn more about CVE identifiers at [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/).

### Platform upgrades

The following platform upgrades help enhance website security and performance. Supported versions of PHP and PHPUnit, Elasticsearch, MySQL, and other dependencies are listed in [Magento 2.4 technology stack requirements]({{page.baseurl}}/install-gde/system-requirements-tech.html).
