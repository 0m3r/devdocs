When the Community Engineering team assesses each Pull Request during processing, they also calculate the Contribution Points to award. Every merged PR receives one of the base achievements and potentially one or more additional achievements. Points will be awarded after the PR has been merged.

For example, your PR may receive Improvement(base), Complex(additional), and Test coverage(additional) which sums up to 40 points.

Achievements applied to pull requests are displayed as labels on GitHub and also published in the section "Magento Contributors" on [magento.com](https://magento.com/magento-contributors)
