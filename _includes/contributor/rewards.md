Magento is thankful for all contributions, and we always recognize our most active members. The aim is to find and recognize our top contributors according to points awarded during a given time period (monthly/quarterly/yearly). Contributors can earn points in numerous ways with a focus in pull requests to the backlog and special projects.

The Community Engineering team assesses each pull request and determines the best awards for the work involved. Contribution Points are calculated according to the assessment results. Each contributor receives points after the pull request is merged.

### How points are awarded
{:.no_toc}

Every merged PR receives one of the base achievements and potentially one or more additional achievements. Points will be awarded after the PR has been merged. Contributors and Maintainers receive the same amount of points due to the level of work completed by each person on the PR.

Examples:

- Contributor submitsPR with complex code contributions: Improvement(base) 10 points + Complex(additional) 20 points = 30 points
- Contributor submitsPR with complex code and tests: Improvement(base) 10 points + Complex(additional) 20 points + Test coverage(additional) 10 points = 40 points
- Contributor submits PR port of existing merged PR:
  - Original contributor: (Improvement(base) 10 points + Complex(additional) 20 points) + Author of Ported Issue 5 points = 35 points
  - Porting contributor: Port(base) 5 points
- Maintainer reviews and approves PR with complex code and tests: Improvement(base) 10 points + Complex(additional) 20 points + Test coverage(additional) 10 points = 40 points

Earned achievements displays as labels on GitHub PRs and displayed per Magento Contributor, Partner, and Maintainer on [magento.com](https://magento.com/magento-contributors).
