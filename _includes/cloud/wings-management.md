**Updating your Pro project**
These sections include instructions for Pro projects updated to manage Staging and Production through the Project Web Interface. For more information adding this management to existing Pro projects (created before October 23, 2017), see [Add Staging and Production to Pro projects UI]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/trouble/pro-env-management.html).

If you do not request this update, you must use CLI commands or tickets to modify settings, variables, routes, and more for Pro plan Staging and Production environments.
