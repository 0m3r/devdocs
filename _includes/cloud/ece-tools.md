The Cloud tools package, also known as ece-tools, contains scripts and {{site.data.var.ece}} commands that automatically perform build and deploy actions of the codebase in your environments:

-   `php ./vendor/bin/m2-ece-build`
-   `php ./vendor/bin/m2-ece-deploy`

Version sequence:  `200<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

These updates contain improvements for the Cloud tools, which are updated as needed through patching and product upgrades managed by the `magento-cloud-metapackage`.
