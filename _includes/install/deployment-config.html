<p>Magento's deployment configuration consists of the following files:</p>
<ul><li><code>&lt;your Magento install dir>/app/etc/config.php</code>, which contains the list of modules</li>
	<li><code>&lt;your Magento install dir>/app/etc/env.php</code>, which contains environment settings, such as:
		<ul><li>Database credentials and connection settings</li>
			<li>Cache storage settings</li>
			<li>Enabled cache types</li>
			<li>Your encryption key</li>
			<li>Web routing parameters (base URLs, URL path to Magento Admin)</li>
			<li>File system paths</li></ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

<p>Together, they are referred to as Magento's <em>deployment configuration</em> because they are created during installation and have information required to start Magento.</p>

  <p>The deployment configuration replaces <code>local.xml</code> in earlier Magento versions. The deployment configuration contains a declarative array of configuration values.</p>
</div>

<p>Unlike other <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}config-guide/config/config-files.html">module configuration files</a>, Magento's deployment configuration is loaded into memory when Magento initializes, is not merged with any other files (although <code>config.php</code> and <code>env.php</code> are merged with each other), and cannot be extended.</p>
