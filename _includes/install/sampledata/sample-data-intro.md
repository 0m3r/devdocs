<h2 id="instgde-prereq-sample-intro">Introduction to Magento sample data</h2>
Magento sample data provides a storefront based on the Luma theme outfitted with products, categories, customer registration, and so on. It functions just like a Magento storefront and you can manipulate prices, inventory, and promotional pricing rules using the Magento Admin.

Installing sample data is optional; be aware that if you do install it, there is no way to uninstall only the sample data. You must uninstall and reinstall the Magento software.
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
    <p>Due to recent changes, you can now use sample data with either the <code>develop</code> branch (more current) or the <code>master</code> branch (more stable) but only if you <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}install-gde/install/composer-clone.html#instgde-prereq-compose-clone">cloned</a> the corresponding branch of the Magento 2 GitHub repository.</p>
    <p>We recommend you use the <code>master</code> branch because it's more stable. If you're contributing code to the Magento 2 repository and you need the most recent code, use the <code>develop</code> branch.</p>
